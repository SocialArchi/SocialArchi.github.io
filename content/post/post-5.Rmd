In the Naidi village of Vanua Levu, a community hall that previously served a total of 400 people from 75 households in the community have been deemed unsafe for use for 7 years. The new community hall by CAUKIN studio took the form of a theatre stage in lieu with the communityâ€™s common passion for the performing arts, and seeks to satisfy both the functional needs and preserve cultural continuity for the Naidi villagers.
