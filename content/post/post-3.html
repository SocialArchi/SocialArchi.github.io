<p><strong>METI Handmade School</strong> is commissioned by a non-government organization called the Modern Education and Training Institute and is a learning institution built for training children to be ready for creative trade-based industries. In Bangladesh, where the project is based, the local knowledge on building materials such as Earth and Bamboo was limited and had not been successfully implemented as a material in the local projects. Anna made use of this opportunity to introduce experts in the architecture industry to educate the local tradesmen and community on and improved traditional building methods using these local materials.</p>
