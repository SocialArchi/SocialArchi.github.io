Housing is a basic necessity and a human right, the ﬁrst step of empowerment towards emerging out of poverty. Co-founders of BillionBricks Prasoon Kumar and Anurag Srivastava envisions “a world where no one is homeless, and where everyone has access to opportunities for economic and social upliftment” (Rebel, 10 Restorative Innovation Initiatives from Singapore You Should Know 2018). BillionBricks is a design and innovation studio with the sole purpose of providing high-quality solutions to end homelessness, to tackle the lack of inadequate housing to the less developed areas.<br><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>ABOUT powerHYDE</strong></span><br>
Conceived as the world’s first carbon positive residence for the homeless, each powerHYDE produces four times the amount of energy it needs for itself. additional energy is sold in order to power other communal facilities — generating additional income for the families who own them. <br><br></p>

<span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>Insights and Takeaways</strong></span><br>
<strong>1. HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR WORK?</strong><br>
It has impacted us as we do not work in Singapore so we travel and work in communities that are generally quite far off or in rural areas where by connection may not be good. We are not used to working online so that is a little hard for us to communicate and to develop new projects in the Philippines. We delayed our plans by 3 months. However, we are now seeing that people there are adapting working to this remote working through zoom. We have been presenting to government officials, we have been presenting to a lot of mayors and common officials online as well. It makes it difficult for us to visit sites and analyse them or site visits which we have not been able to do. But construction had not been affected. <br></p>
<p>From a business standpoint, we are seeing how we can leverage the best possible situation. We do think that travel is going to be restricted for quite some time and that is crucial for us. So what we are doing now is that we are hiring people from the Philippines who are senior level people so I do not have to travel and manage. It would also probably take about a year to raise money and by that time i think that things will start to subside (referring to the pandemic). Or the world by that time will come to terms that ok you cannot travel but you still have to find ways to do work. So it might be that local organisations become even stronger. The work will continue maybe with some glitches but it will be fine in general, the need for housing is not going away. It will probably increase in the current circumstances where people would probably want to move back to the rural areas. Cities will probably look into denser areas like slumps and move people out, which is where we would come in.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>2. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO STUDENTS OR ARCHITECTS TAKING UP SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE PROJECTS?</strong><br>
AlI I want architects to do is the right thing. And do what you speak about. In conferences and schools, you always talk about social architecture and doing things for the community but nobody does it eventually. We talk about sustainability but we still build a glass building in Dubai and we reverse the story around saying “oh this glass is very efficient and it is a very sustainable building” but at the end of the day none of those things matter. So i think we should be truthful whether we really care about the environment, whether we really care about the community or whether we care about ourselves. We should not speak [about] something which is not [what we plan to do].<br></p>
<p>[Another] issue is that we often listen and just accept and we don’t question them. It is important to question everything you hear when somebody tells you especially teachers. You should also question the things that I say. I am sure in social architecture you all have been taught things like community participation in design and that you should involve community. Why do we need to involve the community in design? I live in a house in Singapore and I was never involved in the design and I like it, I like my house. I don’t see the need for people to be involved in it. It could be right as well but nobody questions it. We don’t really learn and understand why. I think that is an important part of learning<br><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></span><br>
<strong>Q1: What other challenges do you face?</strong><br>
Funding is a big challenge. In social design, people expect buildings to be very sustainable, using materials like bamboo, instead of caring for safety and compliances. They want buildings to be done in plastic bottles and stuff which we do not do. So convincing people to provide something not conventional (to poor communities) is a problem. Then people would ask whether we are involving their community in the construction and all but we do not believe in that. I want to provide professional buildings rather than houses that I or my parents will not stay in. So the problem is that my firm looks at things in somewhat an unconventional way, and raising money becomes harder as well in order to do that kind of work. The challenge in general is mostly around financing because in reality, people talk about these projects a lot but nobody really cares and work does not happen. The general perception in society is very different. We do not believe in sustainable design, we do not believe in community construction and we do not believe in community participation. We work professionally whereby we have the skill, there is a need, hence we fulfill that need. <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Q2: Homelessness is a problem in both developing and developed countries. Although less prevalent in developed countries, do you intend on taking up projects in such countries as well in the future? Or in your opinion, should the developing countries be prioritized first?</strong><br>
We have weatherHYDE tents and most of them are deployed in America. We are not biased in which country, we do not believe in a developed or developing country. It is just that the need in developed countries is less. We live in Singapore and there are not too many developed countries around so you tend to work in developing countries. As small proximity helps. We can raise money for the neighbouring countries. Non-profit tend to want to help developing countries and not developed countries..it is more like because of reasons like where do we have an opportunity to work and not from the point of do we want to work for a developing or developed countries <br></p>
<p>If you are talking about powerHYDE, we also do [deploy] them in developed countries as well. We do have them in the Philippines but we are also looking for opportunities in Austrailia and the United States.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Q3: BillionBricks have just changed their model from being an NGO to a for-profit company. May I ask why this decision and what are your plans for the future base on this new model?</strong><br>
I came up with the idea of powerHYDE two years ago and the project was financially viable without grants and fundings from donations. I successfully found someone who would be our investor if we went for-profit as non-profit organisations cannot raise pension money. Essentially, being an NGO, investors cannot make money out of it. So if we can find someone who says that powerHYDE is a strong idea, that we can go and build it for the poor people, and I can make money in exchange for that. <br></p>
<p>For me it does not matter whether it is a for-profit or non-profit, as long as I am able to work in a sector which I like. That’s something I think other people are failing miserably.<br><br></p>
