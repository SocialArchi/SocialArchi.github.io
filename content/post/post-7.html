Kjellander Sjöberg is based in Stockholm, Sweden and provides architectural and urban design services in the Nordic countries. Established in 1998, it is currently a multi-nationality medium-sized office led by partners Ola Kjellander, Stefan Sjöberg, Mi Inkinen and Lena Viterstedt. Kjellander Sjöberg believes that the built environment influences social progress, quality of life and cultural richness. Innovation and sustainability are 2 key drivers in their design. Creating work that is innovative and unexpected while maintaining synergy between resources, high quality built environments and rich social experiences is a part of their philosophy.<br><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>ABOUT Cultural Block Östersund</strong></span><br>
Gustav III Square is historically known to be a public square and was used as a marketplace, entertainment, demonstrations, and meetings. As the city developed, Gustav III Square transformed into a bus terminal. Östersund municipality, together with a real estate company Diös, initiated research to transform the square into a public gathering point for the city with multiple programs. This is done through a consultation process that is reviewed by multiple stakeholders as well as the public.<br><br></p>

<strong>0.1 ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?</strong><br>
It is difficult, but it is a very nice profession. I have been doing this and having my company for over 20 years now. I go to work everyday and I really think it is fantas- tic, it is a fantastic occupation. You get to integrate with so many people and the society at so many levels, as an architecture student you should really reflect on what you want to get out of architecture. Do you do this for other people or do you do this for beautiful graphics or great constructions, or how to push how to build things not to harm the planet? It is good to ask yourself these questions.<br><br>
It is evolving, you do iterations of these in a good project, as an architect you realise there are all these iterations over the years, you constantly feel that you don’t know enough, don’t have enough technical skills. I encourage people to get as rich of a training or work experience as you can, and keep doing things because it is fun, and do more projects with the community. In Sweden we have these projects called summer houses: simple buildings for anyone. You can work on these small projects to train and maybe reflect on what you want. You can also head to large architecture offices and work for a while as a student, and maybe sometimes you feel quite small, and you can’t really affect the direction of the project or the office, but I still think that asking questions and doing things with other people in teams is great.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>0.2 HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?</strong><br>
Sweden has been both criticised for its covid stance, we have been having quite an open society still, people trust the government. We trust and act upon what they do. So we could use Teams and digital meetings and interactive sketches tools without meeting (in real life), and I think that works and this kind of digital processes benefitted us so much.
We really use a lot of sketching. Before Covid, I would say that it doesn’t really work to have these meaningful discussions and sketch on the product in real time, but now I think it is very possible. However, having said that, It is difficult to have very creative early design processes if we don’t meet. We have smaller teams of about 3 to 4 ppl coming in to meet and develop products. In the later phases it is more streamlined where you know your tasks for the coming weeks and focus on the part of the building, and you can have a dialogue online.
Creative processes are still working. We are working on this London project in Enfield, where we created a team in Stockholm and there are like two more design teams in London for landscape and buildings, infrastructure and all that. So I think that works really well, and we can still be creative with new tools. But to a certain degree, we are old fashioned I would say. We like to do hand sketching and models parallel to digital tools. It is really nice to be able to do that. We are a big studio of usually 40 people, now it’s around 5-10 people. So I think it works in a sense that Sweden is still open and we can still meet in a smaller group.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>0.3 BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?</strong><br>
Oh, I’m such an illiterate architect. I read a lot, but not always about architecture anymore (laughs). That’s a difficult question. Now, I tend to read the same au- thors. Recently, I read a lot of Virginia Woolf and I read some Murakami books, like serious reading, and then I switched to another author. I think a book that we have read in the office for a master planning project has been Soft City by David Sim from Gehl Architects. So that’s the most, I would say the most recent book I read that has influenced the way we think about planning. The Soft City about this kind of feeling that the city must be adaptive: both the built structures and the open space structures. Also the soft things like people and parks and public spaces are as important as the buildings. It is a really good book. They go through the Gehl approach in focusing on walkability, and a bicycle culture in a good way in that book.</p>
