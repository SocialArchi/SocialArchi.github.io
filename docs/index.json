Students are exposed to key concepts, methods and goals developed in social architecture, an umbrella term that includes community architecture and planning, community design, social design, democratic design, community development, etc. which share a common approach of environmental design that encourages social behaviors leading towards public interests and common good, such as liveability, safety, and sustainability.\nSocial architecture and public spaces play an essential role in the our society: as areas to foster social interactions, places for cultural practices, and spaces to interact with nature. The role of responsible architects, planners, and urban designers is to design such environments that benefit humanity and ecology. As the world is currently coping with the most serious health crisis of the century, such responsible design becomes all the more crucial now and in the future.\nWhile it is not easy to find works reflecting on this promise in mainstream architecture, there is no lack of ‘creative activism’ within the profession across the world: from disaster relief to vernacular revival and climate resilience, and from tactical urbanism to advocacy in community and social equality. In Singapore, architects, planners and designers have also been advocating for heritage, biodiversity, sustainability, food resilience, and participatory design. These social architects envisage new direction in architecture, take action to bring about change, and use design as a means to encourage others to join them.\nResonating with the theme of SINGAPORE ARCHIFEST 2020—“Architecture Saving OUR World”, students explored the potential roles of social architecture and public spaces in addressing issues of climate change, public health, social equity and cultural continuity. These case studies are documented in two formats: a publication and a website with interactive map. This project, we hope, is only the beginning in bringing together such social architecture movement, to bring forth the spirit of creative activism amidst the dynamically changing world, and to show how architecture can make a difference.\nKeng Hua CHONG \u0026amp; Yohei KATO\nSeptember 2020\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank Singapore Institute of Architects and the Singapore Archifest 2020 Organising Team for the opportunity and assistance in connecting with the selected architecture firms and organisations while conducting this research.

Architecture\nDnA_Design and Architect is an interdisciplinary practice engaged in public buildings, architectural planning, landscape design, and cultural institutions. The studio aims to address contemporary living environments in both physical and social at various scales. DnA_Design and Architecture has done many successful projects, including Brown Sugar Factory, Wang Jing Memorial Hall, Chinese Herbal Garden, and Toufu Factory.\nDnA believes context program, and their potential relationship, will cultivate architecture into a multidimensional expression and generate new experiment and exploration for users. Their approach starts with research and discussion on context, program, and their interaction as the fundamental elements, or the “DNA” that defines design and architecture, to adapt, engage, and contribute to our society of multiplicity and complexity.\nThe studio was invited to attend architectural events such as 2008 UCCA-AAC Beijing Forum and the Aedes Architecture Forum. Brown Sugar factory was nominated for ArchDaily Building of the Year 2019 Industrial architecture. The founder, Xu Tiantian has received WA Chinese Architecture Awards for 2006 and 2008, 2008 Young Architects Award from the Architectural League of New York, Design Vanguard feature by Architectural Record, and 2019 Moira Gemmill Prize for Emerging Architecture.\nABOUT Brown Sugar Factory\nThe Brown Sugar Factory is one of the most successful rural revitalization project examples in China. Covering an area of 1230 sqm, the factory is divided into three functional zones: main production zone, experiential zone, and working zone. Brown Sugar Factory has greatly improved the economy in Xing village and it promotes tourism in the village. As a community space, Brown Sugar Factory created a village community cohesion – a new ‘rural self-confidence’ among villagers.\nDnA_Design and Architecture\n Interview with XU Tiantian of DnA_Design and Architecture\n__Insights and Takeaways__\n__1.

WHAT CAREER ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS?__\n- --\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: In 2013, everyone is talking about the development of urbanization, rural seems to be a forgotten land in China. What makes you pay attention to rural development?\nIn 2013, a rural tourism development plan was initiated by Songyang County government. We were first invited for a hotel project in tea plantation at the end of 2013. We were totally impressed by the landscape and cultural heritage in such an agricultural county. Q2: The ‘architectural acupuncture’ concept has saved China’ s village. Architects are like a doctor here. How do you determine the illness of the village? When you are giving treatments, how do you prevent rural architecture from being urbanized?\nSo we proposed the “Architectural Acupuncture” as a systematic and sustainable rural strategy in Songyang County to regain its “rural self-confidence”. With a minimal intervention approach, multi-functional public programs are introduced to different villages and rural regions tailoring to the complexity of respective cultural heritage and context. Applied with vernacular material and construction technique, architectural acupuncture integrates nature back to the villages that restores their rural identity, as well as stimulates the local economic development. Like acupuncture in Chinese medicine, releases the trapped energy at various meridian points on the body to restore the overall health of the person. Likewise, Architectural Acupuncture is an approach aimed at motivating and inspiring the villages and communities to initiate their own self-regeneration for further development. Moreover, the concept of Architectural Acupuncture aims to activate the dormant resources and generate circulation among the villages in Songyang in establishing a network with the nearby regions and beyond.\nQ3: From a practical perspective, there are many constraints when developing a project in the countryside. For example, low construction technology and low budget. How do you overcome these difficulties during the design process?\nFrom a practical perspective, there are many constraints when developing a project in the countryside. For example, low Despite the scenic landscape, there were also critical issues. Like many rural regions in China, here most rural communities in Songyang were in economic decline, and losing faith in the village’s future. Young people move to the cities for employment, and the villages become “hollow” with a low population of elders. During the first year, we were constantly consulted for village projects. So the first year we took over a dozen pro-bono small scale projects in the rural villages in Songyang, including Pingtian Village Center, bamboo theater, teahouse in damushan tea plantation, etc. All these projects have become learning processes for us to understand local construction materials and techniques, as well as an exchange of ideas that renewed the local’s conceptions on construction.\n","date":"03","image":"images/post/02_DnA_Design and Architecture_1.jpg","month":"Aug","permalink":"/post/dna/","tags":["Citizen Participation","Rural Revitalisation","Cultural Preservation"],"title":"DnA_Design and Architecture"},{"categories":["casestudies"],"contents":"  Project Name: Nepal Rebuilt House Location: Katunje, Dahding Besi, Nepal Date Designed: 2016\nDate Completed: In Progress\nSize: 60 sqm\nClient: Future Village Foundation \u0026amp; IDEA Foundation\nProgramme: Residential ABOUT Atelier-3\nAtelier-3 \u0026amp; Design For People Co. has been a leading force in developing and promoting sustainable lightweight steel houses in rural \u0026amp; ethnic areas since 1999. The main goal of the practice is to improve the infrastructure and living environment of the rural area, leading to sustainable development as well as an ecological society. The team believes that everybody has the right to adequate and affordable housing, unfortunately, the current housing situation is urgent, vast and unsustainable (both economically and environmentally). It has been their mission for the past 15 years to design and develop innovative solutions to these problems. The team does this by designing from the ground up and has developed simple and compatible construction methods that result in housing delivery that is fast, saleable, cheaper to erect, and better for the environment than current building systems. ABOUT Nepal Rebuilt House\nNepal Rebuilt House is a total 60sqm double storey house design by the team that only required simple building techniques to construct. The project aims to rebuild the village by working together with the locals and making use of the existing construction methods and materials on site. Nepal Rebuilt House\n Interview with HSIEH Ying-Chun of Atelier-3\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. MOST OF THE ARCHITECTURE PRACTICE NOWADAYS IS DONE VIA THE INTERNET DUE TO COVID. HOW CAN ARCHITECTS REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVED GIVEN THE TREND NOW? HOW COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECT YOUR WORK NOW AND IN FUTURE?\nThe online communication mentioned here is only the exchange and communication of information. The real immediate impact of the COVID-19 is the logistics and the flow of people. There is no problem with the flow of materials, but there will be problems with the flow of people, and this is the most suitable place and time for our system. When people cannot move, local materials and manpower must be used to build a house. This is the original intent of our system. It can simplify the structure and does not require special skills, and it can be completed in a closed community. The logistics only has steel structure, the transportation cost is low, and the cost of building the house is relatively low, and the remaining materials are local materials. Therefore, under this trend, our system can be more connected with the public.\n2. WHAT IS THE TITLE OF A BOOK YOU RECENTLY READ? WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE BOOK? WHAT READINGS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS?\nOne of my most recent books is “Architecture as Metaphor” by Kojin Karatani. One of my favorite books is the Tao Te Ching, written by Lao Tzu. It is also recommended to students in the Department of Architecture. The ideal society described in the penultimate chapter of the Tao Te Ching is similar to “visible region from eyesight” in Plato’s Utopia. The best state of an ideal society is the state of bliss of “ruling by doing nothing”, without much “doing” by the rulers. In modern countries, the smaller the better, just like Singapore!\n3. WHAT CAREER ADVICE WILL YOU GIVE TO THE YOUNGER ARCHITECT WHO IS PURSUING IN THE FIELD OF HUMANITARIAN AND SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE?\nWe are concerned about the problem of 70% of human settlements, which is a huge area that most professionals have not been able to touch on in the past. Therefore, no matter how many professionals or non-professionals, if you want to dive into this field, there is always work, hence, don’t worry about any work problems. As long as you are open-minded, you can always see things that need to be done.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: In most of your projects, be it post-disaster or not, what is the role of the government or local community in this architecture process you described? How are their roles differ in both scenarios?\nMost people do not understand and have no time to understand our work in the disaster area. Because our approach is non-mainstream, we need considerable experience and foundation to be able to execute it. Not to mention that the government or the general public cannot understand it. People in the field of architecture may not be able to understand and agree with it. Even if there are conceptual ideas, it will be challenging to execute as well.\nFirst of all, the building we emphasize is production behavior and participatory rather than consumer behavior. Especially in post-disaster reconstruction, the matter of allowing residents to participate is beyond the general mainstream idea. We didn’t know until we entered the disaster area that 70% of human housing has nothing to do with what we generally call the construction profession. What the existing construction system in the market can do is not aimed at the 70% of human beings. That field is blank.\nThe so-called 70% of human settlements, regardless of post-disaster or non-disaster, the problems encountered are the same, but the problems of housing in the disaster area must be solved in a short time, which makes it more compressed. Most of the houses of mankind are built by residents, but there is no such thing in our knowledge and education system. Q2: When you begin a new project in the village, especially in a foreign country, how do you build trust with the locals, especially when it is a post-disaster project?\nWhat we generally call “communication” is actually very difficult, especially when it comes to architectural behavior. It contains many complex values, such as aesthetics, habits, emotions, social interactions, communities, etc., so communication is very difficult, whether in the tribe or overseas. For example, Christopher Alexander tried to solve this problem in “Pattern Language”, and Kojin Karatani’s “Architecture as Metaphor”, many of which talk about language, expression, and metaphorーAnd the behavior of these buildings we see actually has various meanings behind it. For example, when we first came to this Thao tribal community (Ida Thao; reconstruction in the 921 earthquake in 1999), how did we communicate with the residents? Basically there was no communication. On the surface, user participation did not happen because they couldn’t understand your drawing, they couldn’t understand your language. Because we were strangers, it was not easy for them to express themselves. So no matter where the project is, do not communicate. The only effective communication is through “behavior” and “action”. Hence, we tried to build a room as our workstation at the gate of the tribal community initially. The residents of the tribe would come over when it was built and give comments, such as how the bamboo should be cut and unknowingly they participated in the process. The configuration of the Thao family house is arranged according to the division of labor by the clans. Some are responsible for hunting sacrifices, some are responsible for sowing sacrifices and etc. The festivals are held by different families in turn. In the past, everyone held these ceremonies on the drying valley, but now there is no drying valley, so the square in front of the house is configured as a ceremony space. But for these rituals and other life habits, most of the tribe would not share the details to outsiders. Therefore, in the process of building houses, we continue to demolish and reconstruct to achieve the current state.\nWhat is the metaphor of architecture? It is actually a specific value behind the architecture given by the designer rather than naturally generated. A building has to include this value, even in its spirit, symbol, form, etc. It is created by the architect (Making), but in the end it may be hidden inside the architecture and may not be seen, because the process of generation (Becoming) is very complicated, and the generated outcome may not be the main part. Thus, the so-called communication is not the communication that most people imagine, and that communication is the most difficult.\nQ3: How did you overcome constraints or conflicts involving the locals in the building process?\nWe know that conflicts always arise inevitably just like one happened in your rebuilt project after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (杨柳村). The “guerrilla building” method (游击造屋) was adopted too, unpredictably, the villagers ended up having conflicts due to differences in the use of materials and construction methods, resulting in the inability to collect all the material costs paid in advance by the team. How do you resolve the conflict at that point in time or what do you think could be done better to prevent this kind of event to happen? In fact, we have never had any way to reduce or avoid conflicts. As mentioned earlier, architectural behavior is extremely complicated. The situation in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Yangliu Village is not uncommon even in the next few projects. Until now, our only practice is to collect payment before delivering.\nQ4: You described the city construction model as consumer behavior and the rural area’s construction model as production. I wonder if the rural area’s construction model can be applied in the cities. On what form do you think will it take if it is to implement this in city area and does it limit by the scale of the project?\nOf course, we have proposed ways to carry out such behavior at high-density living in an urban environment. The concept of “Supports \u0026amp; Infill” has been put forward by various people, from Bauhaus to John Habraken’s “Open Building”. This concept was explicitly put forward in our projects such as Youth Housing in Shenzhen and Hualien, Taiwan. The main structure of buildings should be like bridges and roads – they are public facilities. Once the man-made three-dimensional platform is created, the space inside should be left to the residents and citizens to fill in themselves.\nIs housing in the city a consumer behavior or a production behavior? In cities, the interior decoration of houses is constantly being demolished and rebuilt, while the illegal roofs are all built by people themselves. These are all production activities. Then why did we not consider these changes when we designed the houses in the city? The predecessors in the history of architecture have taught us that the supporting body and the filling content must be separated, and the piping can be assembled and disassembled, but we have not made enough preparations for this.\nHow can production behavior not be in the city? It definitely can be. The concept of a people’s city is that the government or developers lead the construction and maintenance of the main public infrastructure, while the space rights within the framework are sold to the citizens, allowing them to adjust themselves. This concept is closely related to the communication between the communities and the interaction among the residents in the city, similar to the countryside, where every household owns a courtyard, such that building a house is definitely not a simple individual behavior - it has something to do with the neighbors. Q5: Most of your projects focused on the rural village and that your architecture can be seen as resistance to some of the government policy such as the one Bunong village (布农族村落) where some of the villagers resist in moving from their village. What is your view on urban villages (slums) such as one in Indonesia, India or Philippines where people living in these “illegal” squatters faced the fear of being eviction every day and yet they have already been living in this place for years or some decade? How can architecture be used as a form of resistance and validate their existence in the area?\nBuilding a house together is a form of ‘Empowerment’. In the reconstruction for the Thao community, building a house together reconciles the residents and forms a united force to negotiate with the government. A long period of compromise and communication finally led to a consensus. In the tribe, the so-called democracy is compromise. The value of democracy is not that “the minority obeys the majority” but that “the majority respects the minority”, that is, compromise. From African tribes to Taiwan aboriginal chambers, British parliaments, etc…. Meetings are all held in extremely small spaces. With everyone crowded in an unbearable small space with limited mobility, when minority resists, majority will tend to reach a consensus quickly through compromise. Hence, compromise is the core value of democracy.\nMost of the problems in all slums are about the land. For example, in Haiti, most of the land ownership is controlled by six families, so there is no way to rebuild after the earthquake. In this state, there are several reasons to adopt our method. First, our structure can be easily disassembled and can be regarded as not permanent. Under this situation, it will not cause a significant threat to the landowner, and it will be easier to accept. Second, for slum residents, building houses as a production behavior is completely acceptable because originally they have been building the houses and assembling it by themselves and they can do it even more smoothly and take into account the structural safety. All slums are production behaviors, and it aligned with our system perfectly.\nThere are very complicated interpersonal relationships in the slums, which cannot be solved by any current technologies or means. All collaborations must be resolved by the locals themselves, and no one can intervene if it is built by an inch or less. In this kind of community, the subjectivity of each resident is very strong. In fact, it is the same in the tribe, we cannot intervene directly and we must observe their words and actions from the sidelines.\nQ6: What is your biggest take away in your works with the locals?\nThe biggest gain is that it is fortunate to be able to re-understand the so-called “tribal civilization” in modern days. Tribes are likely to be an introduction to a new civilization in the future.\n","date":"04","image":"images/post/05_Atelier-3_1.jpg","month":"Jun","permalink":"/post/atelier-3/","tags":["Citizen Participation","Rural Revitalisation","Renovation"],"title":"Atelier-3"},{"categories":["casestudies"],"contents":"  Project Name: Naidi Community Hall Location: Vanua Levu, Fiji Date Designed: 2018\nDate Completed: 2018\nSize: 130 sqm\nClient: Naqaqa Giving Foundation\nProgramme: Public Space ABOUT CAUKIN Studio\nCAUKIN Studio approaches architecture as a tool of empowerment that every individual and community should have equal access to. The organisation’s take on social architecture seeks to create better quality spaces for marginalised communities by minimising the economic barriers involved in the undertaking of such projects.\nDesigns are conceived around United Nation’s sustainable development goals such as quality education, climate action and responsible consumption, and like the Naidi community hall, holds significant cultural value for the communities involved.\nUltimately, CAUKIN studio is a for-profit organisation, but it successfully proves that pursuing architectural projects that champion social causes need not necessarily be mutually exclusive with the economic goals of a private design firm. ABOUT Naidi Community Hall\nIn the Naidi village of Vanua Levu, a community hall that previously served a total of 400 people from 75 households in the community have been deemed unsafe for use for 7 years. The new community hall by CAUKIN studio took the form of a theatre stage in lieu with the community’s common passion for the performing arts, and seeks to satisfy both the functional needs and preserve cultural continuity for the Naidi villagers. Naidi Community Hall\n Interview with PEASLEY Joshua and MARSHALL Harrison of CAUKIN Studio\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. HOW HAS THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE STUDIO’S ONGOING PROJECTS? HAS IT ALSO SPURRED YOUR TEAM AS A WHOLE TO RETHINK THE WAY SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY SPACES ARE BEING DESIGNED?\nThe situation has definitely affected us, such that we have postponed all our international projects for the next year and by doing that it has given us a lot more free time to think about how we practice as a company as an organization, how we can increase our impact, how we can present ourselves in a more fluent manner which is more reflective of our ethos, so we spent the first few months of that doing a lot of work to improve our way of thinking, and our approach to architecture, moving back into designing spaces when everything sort of picks up again. In terms of how that influences built spaces now and community spaces, I think it will have an influence on certain practices and the way they are being designed and how they put in that emphasis of how a well-designed space can influence your mental health is quite important as people are becoming more aware of it now after spending months and months inside of their own homes, suddenly you cannot really escape and spend all your time outside or doing whatever. The mindset is that I am stuck in a space now for a few months, let us try and make it as nice as possible. A lot of people are aware of their living conditions now as compared to previously, shining some light on the importance of mental health, causing us to question how you perceive your surroundings and how does that make you feel, the need to have a clear space that is not cluttered or very claustrophobic. Something people are really starting to value is the access to exterior spaces, outdoor spaces and how they connect to the outside and wildlife. Most of the communities we work with are rural already so a lot of things we are discussing in the UK with our colleagues and friends may not be directly applicable but as we start to move forward into working in more urban settings, where next year we have a project in Argentina and Buenos Aires, that will be a very dense urban setting area, and that will be probably where it will affect most of our design strategy and making sure that the project has that kind of access to open air spaces, roof terraces, garden spaces, places for people to spend time together when possible but also breakout spaces where people can be in much smaller groups and have their own individual conversations or have some alone time as well. It has definitely highlighted the need for connectivity and what happens when you don’t have that connectedness anymore and the importance of having phases. Once the coronavirus starts to ease up, and hopefully we find a vaccine, there will definitely be a real urge to reconnect and I think as great as it is having Zoom and Google Hangouts, there is still kind of something that is missing, it is never going to be the same as a face to face interaction and if architecture as a part of design can provide a way to provide that, then that would be an ideal situation.\n2. ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE, OVER THE YEARS WHAT KIND OF ARCHITECTS HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON YOU? AND WHAT LITERATURE DO THE BOTH OF YOU GET YOUR INSPIRATIONS FROM?\n\"When we were starting out and even now we are continually there is a network of architects and practices which inspire us. One thing which we are doing during this coronavirus period is sort of this digital workshop that enables us to be looking at our educational side of things and allowed us to get the architects which inspire us and to get them to take part in the workshop. To name a couple, ASSEMBLE has always been very inspiring, they started out in a very similar way to us, as a group of young graduates and they do a lot of projects which were self-initiated in London, and off the back of that project, they decided to actually formulate themselves into an actual organization, creating bigger and all these amazing projects. So for us as students to see somebody else who have already done it and done it very successfully, it was really inspiring how they continue to push themselves to adapt, and to look at new ways to organize their business structure, making sure they have not just plateaued at a certain stage and continue to implement different kinds of community projects. Other practices which inspire us are Matt+Fiona who are also based in the UK, they do a lot of work with children and young people, and initiating the architecture education at a much younger stage, getting young kids involved in creating spaces around them, so they work really heavily doing design workshops at school with the kids, designing the playgrounds or playscapes and then they will get to design a building as well which is a process that is very aligned with our ethos whilst targeting a slightly different demographic, which has been interesting to see their techniques and their methods of doing that. In terms of a more international development sector, there have been a few which have inspired us, from the start of Article 25 they have been very supportive of us and it is quite interesting to see their route, having been working for a long time, they have expanded to so many different countries, something like 90 different countries, which is crazy to think that a single organization can tap into so many different communities and work with so many different characters. And along a sort of similar line, BC Architects and studies, what makes them so interesting is their research branch. Apart from operating as architects in their home country and internationally, they also do a lot of research into materials and vernacular processes, especially the medium of rammed Earth, that is something we would love to do moving forward in the future, into having a sort of a research branch where we are able to explore into a lot of depth an area of interest and apply that into our buildings later on in the project. In a sense having a wider impact on a single building providing a body of knowledge and experience of the material which could be applied to thousands of projects. That is kind of an overview into the practices which kind of inspire us. In terms of literature, they are usually related to other practices into other ways of practicing architecture, there is a book that always comes up in conversations when we were still starting out and it still does now called spatial agency, and which provides insights on how a network of interesting practices run their business and that again is a good reference point to get inspired by and find new practices that are like minded and have similar ambition. 3. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR ARCHITECTS WHO ARE ABOUT TO GRADUATE SOON?\nFor architects who are graduating now, I would encourage them if they have an ambition or idea which can be related to architecture, where they are community based or dealing with social impact groups or it is setting up your own installation artwork. I would encourage you to pursue those aspirations instead of falling into the traditional route, I think people often doubt themselves by having not enough confidence or enough experience, and always think that they should just start working in practice for a few years first and then pursue it later on. But one year becomes five and becomes ten, and they never end up starting whatever their initial dream was and I would probably say that being young as a fresh graduate is probably the perfect time for you to start something, and yes you would not have the experience as you would do later in life but, you would have more time, energy and passion if you were to do it now, and you will learn so much from doing that, you will learn from being on the job in pursuing those different routes and different practices. But if your aspirations is to go to the more traditional route, that is perfect as well for you to create your own career path and aspirations. There is always a way, and I would also recommend you trying to find a group of like-minded group of people, it would be hard for you to self-motivate if it is just you on your own. What made CAUKIN successful and allowed us to continue is because we started as a group with the five of us at the start which was quite large, but it meant that we could distribute the workload, we all had different ideas, all were accountable and everybody kept their motivation up and enthusiasm. But if it was just me on my own, it would be very easy to push tasks off to the side and eventually it never happens. So if you know people that have the same ideas, it would be a good way for you to start things.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: We would like to start off by asking the both of you a little about how your studio came about – we understand that the both of you were still architecture students when the studio was founded, which seems to be rather unconventional as we typically see the idea of starting a practice to be mainly reserved only for a more mature stage of our careers. Having said that, what were some of your experiences in the early years of the practice?\nIt was definitely not the most conventional way of starting a practice –when we started out, we did not have the intention of it turning into our full-time job. It started off with one-off projects, and the ambition to start a practice came from an urge to gain experience but in a way that wasn’t just sitting behind a desk throughout our summer and doing an internship in the more traditional way. The idea came to contact charities or NGOs all over the world and see if there are any opportunities to get in contact with them and put our architecture education in good use. Back at the time we obviously had very limited experiences, qualifications, or portfolio works, so it was definitely very naïve of us to have this ambition; but luckily we came across a charity that put their trust in us and from there we began this project as a group of friends and architecture students. It went quite successfully, and I think the most we learnt from that project was the value we could add to the project because of what we can learn from working with the community, and the local skill and knowledge that the community has. We found that there was a really great knowledge experience for everybody involved, and this is something that we wanted to offer other students. We also knew that it was something we really enjoyed and wanted to keep doing and progress into more projects, to make bigger and better things. From there, we decided to start running more projects each summer, and to find a way in which we can do them in a more sustainable way, that wouldn’t force us to spend most of our time fundraising or doing a lot of logistical work. It evolved quite a lot from the first project which was quite informal to a more organised approach where we have 6 key stakeholders that allow us to run these projects now in a more successful manner. So the first of which is a local NGO partner; we would partner with a charity within the host country and they would be responsible for identifying the needs of the community, building up that sort of trust and network within the local country, organising local logistics, also funding raising for materials and equipment. The second stakeholder is the local community itself, who are involved right from the very beginning, from the brief making process and the design process, making sure that they have the sense of ownership over the building, inputting all their knowledge and skills into making sure that the building is actually what they want and need. We then got the sponsors and owners who are an extension of our network and the NGO’s network, and the other people are involved either in person or financially, such as helping with the costs of materials, or it could be people providing their services such as engineers or environmental design specialists. Then there’s the international design participants of the design workshops and the construction workshops, and the architecture teams all over the world. They bring their own knowledge and experience from their education, and in return they gain on-site skills and see that process from laying the foundation to a built project. Then there’s the local skill workers – we work with the NGOs to identify who in the community would be best based to act as site project managers, people who already have the experience and competency, and their job would be to both educate us, the students and younger members of the community, to make sure that everybody is competent with the skill level and employability (to participate in the project). Finally there’s us, who act as facilitators, and our role in the project then really becomes the overseeing of the stakeholders, the design process, the construction process, making sure everybody is involved, that the community is heard, the NGO is heard.. and to put all of those pieces together. ,br\u0026gt;\nYeah I think as Harrison has said it was quite an unconventional way to start a practice, and as he has also mentioned that it wasn’t exactly that intentional. I think that because we were young and fairly inexperienced and naïve, that it meant that we did not let some of the risks get in the way or even considered what they were - so that naivety kind of helped us break the mold and get started. First of all, the building we emphasize is production behavior and participatory rather than consumer behavior. Especially in post-disaster reconstruction, the matter of allowing residents to participate is beyond the general mainstream idea. We didn’t know until we entered the disaster area that 70% of human housing has nothing to do with what we generally call the construction profession. What the existing construction system in the market can do is not aimed at the 70% of human beings. That field is blank.\nThe so-called 70% of human settlements, regardless of post-disaster or non-disaster, the problems encountered are the same, but the problems of housing in the disaster area must be solved in a short time, which makes it more compressed. Most of the houses of mankind are built by residents, but there is no such thing in our knowledge and education system. Q2: The studio has a mission statement “democratic education, quality design, accessible for all”, which reflects the broad focus that you guys have with regard to the community-focused, bottom up approach towards design. How did the firm arrive at this common goal and vision, and how has this been carried out in your past projects?\nIt was something that has definitely evolved over time and we’ve always had this idea as our ethos, but it has changed and morphed as the years have gone on. This version of it is fairly recent, but we’ve right from the very beginning of the first project, being a charitable project and working with an NGO… we straightaway realised how much architecture and design and engineering could help enhance the sort of spaces that people live in, in communities where people do not necessarily has the access to these skills or these resources. We knew that we wanted to tie that common theme throughout all of our projects and making sure that we maintain that kind of identity with all the communities that we are working with, and I think the three points – education, design and access, kept recurring and coming up in conversations, becoming a core part of our projects. The first theme is education, and for us to really scale the amount of impact we have, there needs to be a knock-on effect more than just the physical building itself. Through education we are able to do that, and we can use our projects as a vehicle to run these workshops to upskill people, such that beyond the individual project we can continue to have a knock-on effect for whatever future building that is constructed in that area, which increases the mobility of the community and increases the sustainable income. That goes on to causing further impacts on children who are studying at the schools and hopefully inspire some of the younger generation to take on careers in engineering or architecture – so the possibilities are endless as we hope. In terms of the quality design statement, I think that’s a reflection of how we try to add value to a project, to rather than simply building the typical standard facility that they would otherwise do themselves. It’s really about challenging how we can use our network, people and resources to add as much value as possible, so it may be looking at engineering to make our structures stronger against natural disasters, or working with environmental design specialists to use passive design methods to improve lighting in a classroom. So that is where the quality design statement is coming from and reflected on what we are interested in over here. Finally, the access to all statement is a reflection of how was want to make sure that quality design should not be something that is just for 1% of the people. I think a lot of architects and students fall into the trap of working for big practices that are designing these luxury homes that cost millions of pounds for a very small percentage of people around the world. This wealth of knowledge and experience that (architects) have; only a small percentage of people are can really experience it. That’s why we talk about broadening that reach and make sure that people are gaining access to this kind of knowledge and experience. It is essentially to give as many people as possible the tools to shape the spaces around them through educating them and designing the structure, and yeah that is kind of our mantra. It’s something that has always been done through our projects but we’ve never really put it into words until more recently, and the lockdown has given us more opportunity to do that, to think more critically about what we want and how we want to present ourselves, and how words can be used to do that. Q3: We have noticed that most of your projects have aspirations that are aligned with the United Nations sustainable development goals – Is there an evaluation criteria set for the projects, to access the degree in which the goals have been met? Yeah that’s a good question – definitely as we’ve developed as a practice that has become much more important to us, which is how we measure the impact of a project, and how we select projects. As we started out, especially as a very young practice with very little experience, we had to take on as many opportunities as possible as they came to us, and the amount of thought that went into sustainable development while doing it was probably quite low on our agenda. Now that we’ve got more opportunities and more projects coming our way, we are able to be a lot more selective and work out where we have the most impact and the most value as well. For us we have three main things that we look for in a project: one of which would be the social impact – how it would impact the wider community and have a improve the general quality of life, so that would be something more like education , a health centre or a community hall. The second thing we look for would be economic impact –something that could increase the economic independence or sustainable income for the community. In 2019 last year we built an oil processing plant in Fiji in a small island called Batiki where they are now able to increase their manufacturing of coconut oil in a dedicated facility and Increase their efficiency rate, which therefore increased their sales and increased the sustainable income for the island as well. That’s something we are looking at increasingly to implement on our projects, and make sure to have an impact that is wider and bigger than just the project itself. The third thing that we look to do is to either have a lower economic impact on our buildings, or a positive impact. So that’s making sure all our materials are sourced sustainably and locally, making sure that they have a very low embodied carbon energy, making sure that our building when being used does not require a lot of energy or upkeep or maintenance. We make sure to take on projects that have an environmental agenda – so last year we did our first major project in the UK, where we were looking to conserve the native dark honeybees. It was a pavilion structure that has live beehives, 25 000 bees, sitting on a site called the Eden project. The purpose of the structure was to increase the awareness of the public about some of the issues, and to demonstrate some of the ways that they can help as well. That’s something that we want to try and push increasingly as we move forward, as we take on more projects that will have an impact on the climate crisis. Something that we are always battling with as architects and the people that build is that it is so difficult to make sure that you are having a positive environmental impact, that’s worth having a conversation about.\nYeah generally as a practice as well, from a project to project basis we want to make sure that there are impact targets, to try and measure the progress and successively on the practice itself. Maybe it is not such an official measure but its looking at things like how many projects we are working on, what is the scale of the projects, where are they located, all these sort of matrix that form ways on how to understand the practice is going and in what direction it is going. We keep track of these things quite closely, so even things like numbers of participants that have worked on our projects both locally and internationally, where they come from.. these are some of the points that we keep track of regularly This year we started on the impact report - it is something that we are going to look for every single year out so that we can keep track of what is well, whether we have reach our targets from the previous year, and if we have not, why that might be, and also to team up with external bodies to conduct their own evaluation of our projects as well. It is one thing to do an internal impact report, but it is so much more valuable to get an external body to take their independent research and going into much more depth than we would have time to do. Q4: After some researching, we have seen that the studio has a history of working on with projects of unique cultural context, notably in Fiji (eg. Batiki coconut oil process plant, Naweni kindergarten, unique air bnb) - how are these communities identified? We would also like to find out if most of the studio’s projects are self proposed, or are they conducted in response to a client’s brief?\nIt is a mixture - the majority is through NGOs, so typically, especially when we started out we would stick to contacting NGOs and charities, and start a discussion with them about what we do, what they do, and work to find out where we can have the most impact in the communities that they currently work with. So by partnering with the charities, they would have the kind of broad knowledge and extensive research of wherever they are working be it at Fiji or Zambia, so they will know where is in the most need, what they need, have the trust from the community already built up from their years of working there. Then we will work with them to come up with a brief making or design workshop at the start of the project, and that would really help us understand the way they currently live, what systems are in place, and where architecture could play a role in increasing their quality of life. There are also projects which we have self-initiated. In Fiji about two years ago, we did a post occupancy survey on one of our kindergartens that we built in 2017, and we have seen that the attendance had gone from 8 students all the way up to 35 students and that they are now turning away potential pupils. That obviously proved to us that our project was successful, but it also highlighted that it could have been more flexible and bigger. So we went back to the NGO and discussed this issue with them on what we can do moving forward in terms of inclusion: we can build a second classroom that utilised the second teacher that they hired and they can run two classes simultaneously to increase their attendance. That was I guess a semi self-initiated project in partnership with a charity, and then the even further stage where we have come up with an entire idea ourselves would be more in relation to how we started working in the UK. I think there is a common idea that working with charities and global issues in different areas in the world or different countries, but right now here in the UK there are plenty of issues as well that needs to be addressed such as mental health or homelessness, so that’s really where we are looking to self-initiate projects where we already have a good idea of the context, the locations and the issues. Even in that scenario we will come up with a brief and some grand ideas and then we would go and take that to a charity or to a funding body or a potential partner, and so there is always going to be that network of stakeholders involved in the project. It just depends on what comes first, if the charity contacts us with an interesting project that they want to do, or if we contact them with a project that we’ve been working on. I think there needs to be a mixture as we move forward, although increasingly it is charities that is reaching out to us first with something that they’ve got in mind. Q5: More specifically, we are currently doing a case study on the Naidi community hall, was it self-proposed or if not, who was the client?\nThat was in partnership with the Naqaqa Foundation Charity in Fiji. We previously worked with them on two projects in 2017, and at the end of the projects in 2017, we spent a few days travelling around other villages to identify where we can have an impact and on a few projects in the following year of 2018. So we came across Naidi Village which is very close to the charity headquarters and somewhere which they have worked with quite extensively beforehand. So they have already had that connection and knowledge, and have already identified that community seven years ago, looking to construct a new community hall for a long time but they did not have the funds to do so, so that’s where the idea of the project came about. Then the Naqaqa Foundation partnered up with the Jazmin fund which is an extended branch of their charity to help fund it and fundraised for that build. Essentially, the clients were the Naqaqa Foundation and the Jazmin Fund on the charity side of it, also the Naidi village who are the people who are ultimately going to be using it, and it has to be perfect and right for them. In essence, most of the interactions with the clients and community, are done in the capacity as the end users. While things that relates to the funding and fundraising would be with the NGO and charity departments.\nQ6: With the international nature of many of your projects, what are some of the challenges you have had to overcome? For instance, language or cultural barriers that the team has had to get accustomed to or work around?\nWe have been quite fortunate in a sense that a majority of places that we have worked there has been a level of English which is fairly good, good enough for us to get by. But on some projects it has helped massively to have somebody who can speak both English to me and the local language to the community. One of our projects in Vanuatu last year, we had our charity partner from the Tanbok Project, Rachel, she was on the project with us for the entire duration, and she previously lived in Vanuatu for a few years and had learnt the local language fluently. And even though the community could speak English at a fairly good level but having her there with the command of the native language, it has helped her to be able to really breakdown any kind of barriers there might be and build up that relationship much quicker. As well as getting a much better insight into exactly what their needs were and exactly what were their thoughts on the project going forward. That was really invaluable to have, and ideally in any project it would be helpful to have somebody like that. I think in a more extreme scenario was during a research project in rural India, where we had stayed in a small village for a few nights where there was completely zero English whatsoever. That was our very first experience working with a community that had no English (speakers) at all, that was definitely interesting and a sort of a learning curve, luckily we had a translator with us, but during the communication process so we were able to find out about their experiences through the translator, we did not know if this put up any barriers. They are still able to express their thoughts and wants to the charity directly as well which will then be relayed to us, but it does make the process a little longer.\nQ7: Could you share some of the instances where conversations with the community have directly inspired the design of the project? Does this usually occur organically, or through structured design workshops conducted by the studio?\nIt certainly happens both organically and through the workshops. Typically, it happens more often organically. Usually it happens from us being there ourselves, especially when revisiting old projects time and time again. In terms of the design workshops, this time last year in late September we finished a project in Ranwas village in Vanuatu, we travelled up to Tanbok area which was where we were supposed to be building this summer but has been postponed to next summer because of the coronavirus. We conducted a design workshop with the community there to work out what they needed. We knew they needed a school building, and we knew it was going to be a classroom library space but we wanted to know if there was anything else which we could add to it and also where it was going to go on the whole site, what they wanted it to look like, what kind of materials they were expecting. And quite interestingly the site that was selected wouldn’t be your first assumption as the best site of the build. It was right on a big drop on the edge of a hill and even though there are flat spaces around but I think they sort of quite like the idea of having more than one storey, having a double level space, which was something that was quite rare and unusual to really find that in any village. Especially something that is home built, or self-built rather. I think that they may have taken a liking to a recent building which was constructed a few miles from their village which was a slightly bizarre multi-storey structure, and they must have seen it and been like “oh it would be quite cool to have something like that”. So that was the site that was selected because by having that sort of split level already there on the ground level. And you could utilize the classroom up on the top floor and then a set of stairs onto a larger space. And sort of where a mezzanine level can sort of be, with people walking below it, creating a few playful elements which we could explore. Another benefit to that site as well, was that there was a lot of space underneath the building for the kids to have their lunchtime space. Something which they talked about was that during the event of raining during lunchtime, they will have a place to chill there to have their lunch or between lessons. So that was something I wanted to include in my design, to have the overhang which meant that we could incorporate that with no extra cost. As the budget of the project is extremely tight so it is about getting as much space out of these buildings and materials as we can. That is quite a good example of how a design workshop specifically influences the design and when it happens organically it is during the construction process. We typically only design about 70 to 80 percent of the actual project and that would be things like the structure and engineering side, any materials which we will need to order in advance and those kind of bigger picture ideas. And then we will leave the rest to be designed on site, like the doors, windows, stairs or whatever it may be and that allows us to handover ownership to the community, where people will come up with all kinds of interesting doors or cladding or interiors, and that’s where all of the organic decisions really happen.\n","date":"05","image":"images/post/06_CAUKIN Studio_1.jpg","month":"May","permalink":"/post/caukin_studio/","tags":["Rural Revitalisation","Cultural Preservation"],"title":"CAUKIN Studio"},{"categories":["casestudies"],"contents":"  Project Name: Bima Microlibrary Location: Bandung, Indonesia Date Designed: 2015\nDate Completed: 2016\nSize: 160 sqm\nClient: Dompet Dhuafa, City of Bandung\nProgramme: Education ABOUT SHAU\nSHAU (Rotterdam-Bandung) was established in 2009 by married partners, Florian Heinzelmann and Deliana Suryawinata, as two independent offices in Rotterdam and Munich and serves as common platform.

The individual offices collaborate on a project basis and combine their extensive working experiences in well-established and internationally-recognized architecture firms where they successfully worked on numerous projects on various scales. SHAU offers a broad scope of services ranging from urban to architectural project commissions. SHAU is mostly interested in delivering outstanding design solutions while embedding societal as well as environmental concepts in the design process.\nABOUT Bima Microlibrary\nBima Mircrolibrary is one of the first Microlibraries built by SHAU an attempt to elevate the education level of the Indonesian population through multi-use microlibraries for social and eductation purpose. The project is a collaborative effort from 7 stakeholders: SHAU, Community, Funding partner, NGOs, Media, and most importantly, the Government.\nSHAU\n Interview with HEINZELMANN Florian and SURYAWINATA Daliana of SHAU\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. HOW HAS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR WORK NOW? HOW WILL COVID-19 INFLUENCE YOUR FUTURE DESIGNS? WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU HAVE LEARNT AS AN ARCHITECT?\nPopulation are not that lucky. They need to go out and interact to make their living. They need to be at places physically. Does it influence our designs? Yes and no. It is difficult to explain and greatly depends on the context. In Indonesia where social distancing is not really possible or enforceable and a lot of places in urban locations are totally overcrowded, what can one do? What can design change when you first need people to be willing, to be able to financially afford and be able to understand to behave accordingly? The other aspect also in more developed countries is that people get annoyed and irritated about lockdowns and restrictions by now. We fear there is one big Covid-19 wave, or the second wave is nearby like with the Spanish flu in 1918-1920. What we are more scared of are the scars it will leave on our society. A lot of people and institutions have shown their true colors in the face of the crisis like splitting, segregating, scapegoating, outright lying, hoaxing, conspiracy theorizing, instead of collaborating, working together and trying to solve the problems. That happened not only bound to certain countries but also on international levels. How can we recover from the financial but also damage our trust has taken? How can architecture help there? May be, we need memorials, reminding us of those we lost, of those who fought to help others, a place of collective memory, never to forget when another, similar incident hits us. Everybody knows about World War I\u0026amp;II but till Covid-19 nobody talked about the Spanish flu. We suggest therefore to build a Covid-19 memorial with all the names of those who died, with all the names of people who died in service to society while rethinking social distancing as one of the major design features.\n2. FURTHER INSPIRATION: WHAT ARE SOME BOOKS THAT EVERY ARCHITECT SHOULD READ?\nFlorian:\nI am not so presumptuous to tell people what they should read, because everybody has their own interest. However, I found the recent book by our friend Nirmal Kishnani with the title Ecopuncture very interesting. I recently started to read Gottfried Semper’s The Four Elements of Architecture and had quite some laugh because of his snarky comments about his contemporary society. Need to finish it though. A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History by Manuel DeLanda is a must read. I still need to read Philosophy and Simulation. I have it on my phone but did not find time. Peter Sloterdijk’s Spheres III is a great read but one has to be critical with his more recent opinions towards refuges in Germany and gender questions. Daliana:\n“Ekistics” by Doxiadis- rare book but very interesting. Then “49 Cities” by WorkAC, which has a comparison of mostly visionary urban designs ever made. “Theories and manifestoes of contemporary architecture” edited by Charles Jencks and Karl Kropf. Good to have: “S M L XL” by OMA and “FARMAX” by MVRDV- architects should have these two classics on their book racks.\n3. ANY PIECES OF ADVICES FOR BUDDING ARCHITECTS TODAY?\nBe open to everything. Accept differences in people. Do not only hang out with architects; they do not have projects. Better start something rather than ponder while overthinking it. You do not know your journey ahead and as much as you think you know what you want and you are in control, your environment and opportunities will shape you. Sure, have a stance and an opinion but again be open and flexible. The universe’s only constant is change. Do not listen to the nay-sayers or haters. You are never too young or inexperienced to do a thing. Take risks, but also be responsible with the consequences. We all do our share of mistakes, but we all need to recover and learn from it.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: Inspiration: What inspired both of you to start SHAU? Do you consider yourself as social architects, why or why not?\nWe have been working for other well-known companies in Germany, Indonesia, and the Netherlands before like OMA, UNStudio, MVRDV and West 8. However, it was always clear to us that this is an intermediate step before starting our own firm. It was just a question of when to do it. Do we see ourselves as social architects? Difficult question. What is a social architect? We for sure have a social and environmental agenda but we also need to operate as company and need to generate income to pay our staff and ourselves. Yes, we do work for communities, sometimes less paid but in the end the balance has to be right. We actually prefer smart solutions where every party involved is benefiting in as many ways as possible.\nQ2: Inspiration: “Buku adalah Jendela Dunia” (The book is a window to the world) is a phrase that inspired this movement. Can you tell us more about this phrase and its effect on the Microlibrary movement? How would you describe your microlibraries design approaches?\nWhen we designed the first Microlibrary Bima, we had the ice cream buckets for the façade in which we wanted to cut holes into for having better cross ventilation and were thinking how to arrange them. We could have done a random pattern but then we realized we can interpret them as ones and zeros, as binary code. So we went to back-then Mayor and current governor of West Java Ridwan Kamil (our patron for many libraries) and asked him what message does he want to inscribe on the façade and he said: ‘Buku adalah jendela Dunia’. Books are the windows to the world, a quote made in similar versions by many bibliophiles before. We ourselves have great interest in books and have spent countless hours reading out loud to our son and therefore think that books especially for kids should play an essential part in everyone’s lives. So yes, books indeed are windows to another world. Especially for those who might not be that mobile and able to travel. Many authors have not been to the places they are writing about, but only travelled in their imagination, and we are not talking about sciences fiction or fantasy literature. In Indonesia, Unfortunately, reading a book is often seen as punishment. Therefore, one of our design strategies is to design around communities and activities to lure children and parents inside. Creating ludic places in order to make them read. Changing people’s attitude towards reading and books, transforming it into something positive due to a great experience they have at Microlibraries.\nQ3: SHAU has built a few microlibraries so far and there are more coming in your pipeline. Looking at the reception from the communities there are more projects that are accepted better than others, how do you think the involvement of the local community is crucial? Would SHAU revisit past Microlibrary projects and improve it?\nYes, it is crucial, and we learned that the hard way. The story of Microlibraries includes not only successes but also struggles. One is turned into a mushola (prayer room) and one got torn down by the regent of Bojonegoro to erase her predecessor’s legacy. Luckily, the positive results are outweighing the bad ones. However, we are not going to design a library anymore without knowing beforehand or during the design process who the community will be. We are not talking about the people who will visit but more like the volunteers and people who will be positioned there. Without a good community which is organizing events and activities, the library will be just an empty shell and it will fail. The community is actually the most important part. You can have a library in a shed as long as you have people coming, reading, taking care, and organizing. The building itself almost does not matter. Of course, a good design helps a lot to create a special place and identity for the neighborhood. And in the case of microlibraries we are indeed using architectural design to attract users. Great design is an added value. In terms of improvement, it is a constant journey for us to successively improve our designs but also communication with the communities and finding the right partners. Q4: SHAU view on their environmental responsibility: One of your missions stated is to create environmentally responsible designs. In what ways is environmental responsibility integrated into your projects? What are some challenges that SHAU has faced in trying to be environmentally responsible?\nWe want to always include that aspect into our buildings. With Microlibraries it is actually quite easy to do so since we are not only responsible for the design but also often securing our own sponsors and therefore have larger degree of freedom to make end decisions. Due to the building size, we can do a lot with passive climatic strategies, plants, or material aspects. The challenges are more at bigger commercial projects especially housing with developers. Commercial projects still view green building as a buzz word, something to lure the client to buy their “product” without taking that matter really seriously, because it would be too much investment and thus not cost-efficient. Indonesia is in that respect also more challenging. The general public has growing environmental awareness, but the regulations or the enforcement thereof do not support that. And developers do not have better solutions. We have the dirtiest river, Citarum near Bandung where several textile industries are pumping in their wastewater so that the developed countries –including Singapore– can consume cheap clothing. That is the big irony, and this is only a small example. Not only is Indonesia exploited for its natural resources but on top of that a toxic wasteland and sick people are left behind. Indonesia has a problem with their environment on a massive scale going through all levels of society and it needs to change. Even when hiking at remote areas somewhere in the hills north of Bandung, one finds plastic waste in the forest left behind by the locals.\nQ5: SHAU Sustainability as a Practice: As Architects with many social projects, how do you ensure the sustainability of your practice, what are your tips for other architects that would like to be more involved in social architecture?\nWe cross finance projects at the office in a balanced way. We have commercial projects from masterplans to performing arts center. For microlibraries, the design fee is calculated in a fair way too. We all need to pay rent, tax, salaries, insurances and other costs too. It is not easy at times and here and then there is a struggle. But famous architecture practices worldwide also have similar problems. Because architecture design is less about the money and more about contributing great designs to society. But we have to be responsible in financing ourselves. Just because we do work for communities does not mean we and our staff do not deserve a salary.\nQ6: The previous questions focused on the Microlibraries project, could you share with us some notable learning points from your other social architecture focused on projects like the Taman Film (Film Garden) or the Alun-Alun Cicendo?\nAt Taman Film, we learn about community’s sense of ownership. Taman Film is designed in such a way that it does not only accommodate movie screening for a large audience, but also to function as a seating and activity landscape while nobody is watching. The existing topography naturally descends towards the river. Curvilinear steps with different inner and outer radii were proposed. The intention was to give people pockets of different sizes to form “rooms” for groups to be able to chat with each other or occupy an enclave to have a more excluded, individual experience. The park is fully covered with different shades of green of artificial grass and due to curvilinear geometry of the steps. The ‘fluffiness’ of this public space gives a ‘Kuschelecke’ (German word for a hugging corner) quality. That and the fact that the whole area is rain protected due to the overpass acting as roof, makes people take off their shoes and treat Taman Film more as an indoor rather than an outdoor environment. Residents in nearby urban villages use it often anytime of the day, with or without movie screening. The sense of belonging built up naturally among residents. Perhaps they have claimed it as their ‘urban living room’, where neighbourhood kids play after school and babies took their first steps. Every week there are various gatherings, large and small, from mothers doing weekly arisan –an Indonesian social gathering between women involving collective fundraising and a lucky draw every month – to all sorts of hobby communities. We also spotted local Taekwondo clubs doing their training there. In the weekend there are vendors sitting at the bottom stairs of the Taman Film selling long ‘balloon swords’ for kids to play with, while families are having picnics. The most spectacular use of the Taman Film however was when ‘Persib Bandung’, the local football club was playing and winning the Presidential Cup in 2015. That very evening, Taman Film was filled to the brim with thousands of spectators supporting their team and participating in the public viewing event. As the designers of the park, we were taken by surprise that in comparison to other parks in Bandung, seven years after it was opened, it is still relatively clean and maintained. There is an unwritten agreement between residents to take shoes off before entering the space, like when someone would enter a carpeted living room or a musholla (a small mosque). Users don’t leave their garbage there. The residents seem to have their own cleaning schedule, which is heart warming, knowing that this kind of gesture is not seen in other public spaces in Bandung. In Alun Alun Cicendo, users positively surprise us with how they use the spaces spontaneously. It is a 5400m2 multi-programmatic public space featuring open air sculptures. Since it was opened in 2018, it has been a popular hotspot for a large spectrum of users from school children to elderly, from bride-grooms taking pre-wedding photos to serious drone communities. Since the presence of blacksmith kiosks and second-hand steel vendors defines the characteristic of the neighbourhood, the usage of steel as the main material is important. Local workers were hired as craftsmen to further motivate their sense of belonging. The design intention is to blend multiple experiences and programs in a seamless way, using contour to define public and private areas. The programs include skate area, an art market, basketball field, seasonal pavilion, main square, amphitheater, office, musholla, toilet, street vendor kiosks, parking area, Zen garden and a canyon ending in a water feature for children. Rusted steel ribbons are used to organize the flow of visitors around these functions in form of a topography of stepped hills, lending its form to the surrounding landscape of Bandung. There are numerous designated and spontaneous gathering points. What surprised us as designers are for example how the Zen garden which is a dry garden with stones is used as a reflexology place, or as a play space for kids. The next thing is there are aluminum seats which we designed on the upper deck, which were used as tunnels for kids to play and a see-saw when turned upside-down. Users’ creativity in appropriating furniture at Alun Alun Cicendo can be so inspirational.

BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?__\n- --\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: What sparked your passion for social issues and using architecture as a medium? Specific project (More Than Just a Library).\nCorporate Social Responsibility has always been part of our company’s culture since its inception in 2004. We conducted a fundraising for an orphanage in Vietnam and visited the children as an office in the year 2008. This was followed with our involvement with our local Sun Love Home, as an event sponsor as well as helping out on food distribution on an ad-hoc basis. We are thankful for the opportunities to work on projects in Phnom Penh city for the past 10 years. The humble library project is just a small way of giving back to the people of Cambodia. I just thought as an architect I could contribute in a meaningful way that also puts my skills to the best use. Q2: What are some social issues in Cambodia that could benefit from an architectural intervention? Can design solve some of these pressing issues developing countries face?\nThe majority of underprivileged people in developing countries do not have access to and any form of contact with an architect. The project we did was very much a modest but direct contribution to a small underprivileged community. Yes, good design can definitely enhance the wellbeing of the people at large and allow for resources to be put to optimal use. Essentially, we wish that our humble intervention can raise awareness and inspire more of such improvements to be initiated. Q3: What inspired your team to conceptualise the “More Than Just a Library” project?\nWe are certain that education is a sustainable way for children to exit the vicious cycle of poverty. Having completed a few library projects in Singapore, we wanted to explore a library that could be fabricated off-site and transported to a remote rural place economically, quickly and readily to be used. In addition, we strive for a library that responds to the deficiency of a rural context and remains as a sustainable facility in the long term. Q4: An interesting point posted on the firm’s website is that 44 NGOs have been approached to sustain, operate and manage the Library in the long run. CCDO was then chosen as the primary beneficiary. We would love to know the selection process and what was performed to ensure a large extent of credibility as well as continued participation of stakeholders could be achieved?\nThe fact was the majority of the 44 NGOs did not respond to us, as probably it was unbelievable that an architecture firm so far away was giving away a library. I did a visit to the shortlisted organizations personally, to ensure that the chosen one was indeed in need of the proposed project. It was also necessary to make sure that the organization had the relevant support to run a programme and upkeep the library in future. Q5: Were there difficulties trying to communicate with the local community prior to commencing the project, e.g. when interviewing children using the space? What are other challenges and constraints that cropped up/typically arise in social architecture projects and how were they combated?\nThe process was generally enjoyable and my regular visits to the site helped to put across the expectations of the delivery. However, even while operating on a comfortable pace we still faced a critical problem halfway through the construction phase. The builder, who had all along been very supportive of this project, got into financial difficulty. He avoided all communication despite the completion deadline drawing near and I had to make a personal visit to his place to resolve his personal problem together. Otherwise, we are thankful that our partner CCDO on the ground was very cooperative to facilitate the involvement with the school and community. Q6: Could you please share more about your latest project? How it started and evolved over the course? What are some learning points to takeaway from it. Sustainability of the project and future plans?\nWe are currently working on a tertiary educational complex in Phnom Penh. This is a formal and forward-looking institutional project. Our nature-centric design approach aims to allow the user to have a close connection with the environment, and we also injected programmes that encourage social interaction and growth. Q7: Following the success of the More than just a Library project, how do you think the lives of the community will change with the introduction of the Library? How does one ensure architectural resilience, especially when it comes to trying to impact the lives of these children in the long run? Did you observe any new social behaviours that arose from the project implementation?\nWe involved the school community during the process and hoped that they would take pride in their library. We were heartened to learn from the videos sent by the school that the children love the completed library very much. We gathered that many children prefer our library to the playground next to it. The school volunteers have also used the space as an outdoor learning space, rather than just a place for books. Besides the school community, the project has also benefited the 25 of us from Singapore who attended the handing over ceremony. Our group comprised of my colleagues as well as 5 young Singaporean families with 11 children in total. It was an enriching experience for all of us, and definitely a good exposure for all our kids. Q8: The design fabrication of screens really stood out. As the implementation of the traditional craft was supported and performed by the locals, were there instances where certain designs were preferred over the other, and if so, how were these designs reconciled at the end? If not, how did all the designs come together to form the cube facade?\nThere was a strong intent to reflect the essence of the Khmer culture and give it an inspirational feel. Our team of designers came up with a few 1:1 scale mock ups using actual rattan in our office, in order to understand the nature and limit of the material. It was an exploratory process with reference to Khmer daily household items found in the rural area. We tested numerous designs and eventually settled with 36 designs that appear rich in texture, and yet could be achieved economically. Q9: Will IXA continue to participate in social projects internationally? Do you see a possibility in extending the same value of community work in the context of Singapore? What might the reason for the lack of community work in Singapore be attributed to? How can the community actively contribute to social schemes apart from monetary contributions?\nWe certainly wish to continue to pursue social projects in the region and locally where possible. There are many community initiatives around in Singapore. However, works related to our built environment are regulated tightly and we wish there could be more room and support for ground-up initiatives. I feel we are generally better off than people in the developing countries. More attention could be channeled to the needy in our neighbouring countries that do not even have the fundamentals such as having a latrine in a house. I believe that collectively we can be a stronger team if we collaborate. We just have to spread the message and get it going. I am very glad that the library project has been an encouraging one and it motivated me to lead another humanitarian project on the provision of 100 latrines in early 2020. It was a project that brought together more than 20 Singapore architects and friends, as well as more than 100 Cambodian villagers and students. We faced challenges too but I have learnt that nothing can stop us if we do it wholeheartedly and persevere on. The truth is we take away far more than what we have given.

Established in 1998, it is currently a multi-nationality medium-sized office led by partners Ola Kjellander, Stefan Sjöberg, Mi Inkinen and Lena Viterstedt. Kjellander Sjöberg believes that the built environment influences social progress, quality of life and cultural richness. Innovation and sustainability are 2 key drivers in their design. Creating work that is innovative and unexpected while maintaining synergy between resources, high quality built environments and rich social experiences is a part of their philosophy.\nABOUT Cultural Block Östersund\nGustav III Square is historically known to be a public square and was used as a marketplace, entertainment, demonstrations, and meetings. As the city developed, Gustav III Square transformed into a bus terminal. Östersund municipality, together with a real estate company Diös, initiated research to transform the square into a public gathering point for the city with multiple programs. This is done through a consultation process that is reviewed by multiple stakeholders as well as the public.\nKjellander Sjöberg\n Interview with SJOBERG Stefan of Kjellander Sjöberg\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. HOW HAS THE COVID SITUATION AFFECTED YOUR WORKFLOW?\nSweden has been both criticised for its covid stance, we have been having quite an open society still, people trust the government. We trust and act upon what they do. So we could use Teams and digital meetings and interactive sketches tools without meeting (in real life), and I think that works and this kind of digital processes benefitted us so much. We really use a lot of sketching. Before Covid, I would say that it doesn’t really work to have these meaningful discussions and sketch on the product in real time, but now I think it is very possible. However, having said that, It is difficult to have very creative early design processes if we don’t meet. We have smaller teams of about 3 to 4 ppl coming in to meet and develop products. In the later phases it is more streamlined where you know your tasks for the coming weeks and focus on the part of the building, and you can have a dialogue online. Creative processes are still working. We are working on this London project in Enfield, where we created a team in Stockholm and there are like two more design teams in London for landscape and buildings, infrastructure and all that. So I think that works really well, and we can still be creative with new tools. But to a certain degree, we are old fashioned I would say. We like to do hand sketching and models parallel to digital tools. It is really nice to be able to do that. We are a big studio of usually 40 people, now it’s around 5-10 people. So I think it works in a sense that Sweden is still open and we can still meet in a smaller group. 2. DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC BOOK THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND STUDENTS TO READ?\nOh, I’m such an illiterate architect. I read a lot, but not always about architecture anymore. That’s a difficult question. Now, I tend to read the same authors. Recently, I read a lot of Virginia Woolf and I read some Murakami books, like serious reading, and then I switched to another author. I think a book that we have read in the office for a master planning project has been Soft City by David Sim from Gehl Architects. So that’s the most, I would say the most recent book I read that has influenced the way we think about planning. The Soft City about this kind of feeling that the city must be adaptive: both the built structures and the open space structures. Also the soft things like people and parks and public spaces are as important as the buildings. It is a really good book. They go through the Gehl approach in focusing on walkability, and a bicycle culture in a good way in that book. 3. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO ARCHITECTURAL STUDENTS?\nIt is difficult, but it is a very nice profession. I have been doing this and having my company for over 20 years now. I go to work everyday and I really think it is fantastic, it is a fantastic occupation. You get to integrate with so many people and the society at so many levels, as an architecture student you should really reflect on what you want to get out of architecture. Do you do this for other people or do you do this for beautiful graphics or great constructions, or how to push how to build things not to harm the planet? It is good to ask yourself these questions. It is evolving, you do iterations of these in a good project, as an architect you realise there are all these iterations over the years, you constantly feel that you don’t know enough, don’t have enough technical skills. I encourage people to get as rich of a training or work experience as you can, and keep doing things because it is fun, and do more projects with the community. In Sweden we have these projects called summer houses: simple buildings for anyone. You can work on these small projects to train and maybe reflect on what you want. You can also head to large architecture offices and work for a while as a student, and maybe sometimes you feel quite small, and you can’t really affect the direction of the project or the office, but I still think that asking questions and doing things with other people in teams is great.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: Kjellander Sjoberg (Schellander Sjoberg) has a vision to improve living conditions and environments when designing and contributing to neighborhoods and meeting places. How are the local community and local stakeholders involved in the design process?\nThere is a difference between the urban design and planning projects and architectural projects. We do both figure planning commissions and we work with a lot of architectural projects like residential development. In the first one, when we look at the bigger urban projects, we sometimes have to take the perspective of doing something really good and long term for the community. We certainly do enjoy doing it with the community, and the ambition is to have good dialogue and really meet different local groups and initiatives. However, that doesn’t always happen, of course. We work with different municipalities and sometimes even private companies or clients that would own a big piece of land. Our ambition is to find these local communities and work with them. There are different ways you can go about this. We can find more representative groups or people, or if you just trust that the key people that would really use the place will join. We think that it is really important to have a kind of framework, an overall framework that would make this development sustainable. And people can add to that, maybe change it a bit but somehow add to it. If there is an initial framework in place it is easy for people to add their input to it.\nQ2: Referencing the recent public hearing for the Gustav III Square, held over two months, how active was the community in actually providing feedback and how useful were they?\n(*Prompts: E.g. Substantial amount of respondents vs a handful of people giving lots of their own personal views. How much of this feedback is actually being incorporated.)\nThere had been different dialogues in the city of Ostersund in northern Sweden. The dialogue is about what kind of programming or what kind of brief that we would have. As an architectural company we work together with private developer Diös who will actually build the buildings. I think the municipal meeting (public hearing) is perhaps a bit late (for this project). A lot of times, the people are worried that the public voice will change the product too much. However, I think in this case, the ambition is to build a new hotel and new residential units and commercial units, like shops and restaurants facing the streets. But it is also a really clear program with public spaces that are informal built on the code of that city, which is a really informal older wood timber city with narrow alleys.\nI think the public hearing is really important and the public hearing that took place in this case is kind of legistated: the kind of procedure that you need to follow as a city in Sweden when you plan for a site. In some cases, it works: a lot of actors and a lot of stakeholders get to be heard automatically. That is the base of planning in Sweden, at least, or in many of the northern Scandanavian countries. Outside of that we would like to have this co-working process with municipalities or groups.\nTo answer the question quickly, there was a public hearing and people could sign and hand in their complaints or even suggestions. And that works at a general level, but it would have been so much more satisfying if the dialogue went through the process as it continues.\nThe basic model here is quite democratic, we have it in our DNA but then it could be really nice to really sit down and talk to people. Most people probably don’t know how exactly to shape this kind of square and public development, but still you could still get some public ideas and public feedback on how they would like to use it.\nQ3: For projects like this in Sweden where you are working with municipal agencies, how much influence does the developer (e.g. Diös pronounced Dee ers with silent r) have over the decisions of the design process as well as incorporation of feedback?\nIn Sweden, like everywhere else, architects don’t really have the power to fully decide, since there are goals like financial goals. But I think it’s how you frame what kind of question you raise, about the way we as architects or planners frame projects and raise questions that really shapes what will be done and built. I think raising a dialogue is important and I think in this case in Ostersund you mentioned that there was a lot of discussion about how the public character of the project could be truly public, because if you privatise (in this case roughly about 70% of the project), it is a square but it is a bus square right now, how should we go about designing it? By raising questions like what kind of quality space, studying and walking around to find a meaningful way to shape these urban spaces, in that case you might find a strong concept that allows you to satisfy the municipal’s and developer’s needs while shaping the direction of the project.\nQ4: In Singapore, the recent coronavirus situation has shed light on a demographic largely neglected in the process of design for community spaces, which are the migrant workers. Drawing parallels to Sweden, the country is known to have taken in a large amount of refugees over the years; one of the highest intakes in the world over the past decade. Though minor compared to the population, this steadily growing new demographic presents a new question about the integration of refugees into the discussion and design process of community spaces. What are your takes about how this process would work in Sweden? Perhaps from there we could extract relevant points for application in Singapore.\nI think it is a really huge question that we could discuss for a couple of days (laughs). I would say since the refugee crisis in 2015, we received many migrants that fled from mainly Syria. This of course affected the population and the way we as the planning profession acted in Sweden, we are mostly active in Stockholm and Malmö, but they present similar challenges. In Malmö there is a huge focus on inclusion and trying to make the city, both the fabric and other aspects like the population and education more connected and integrated. The positive side in Sweden, is that the planning process has democratic pivot points that aims to provide everyone with the same proximity to care, free education, that’s including everyone whether you are a citizen or migrant. You have these benefits and opportunities. But then again in the physical reality, you have neighborhoods that are deprived, they tend to be clusters of people new to Sweden. The positive thing is that we try to shape an equal society, but I don’t think we are there yet because we still have much to catch up on since 2015. I think there is a strong feeling that everybody must have a home to live in, a kind of basic need. The needs we are not achieving yet is really including everyone in the Swedish society. I think everyone is welcomed in a way, but we don’t really have the financial and political strategies to curb this problem.\nWe did an exhibition recently called Commoning Kits in Malmö at the former design centre, and we had this idea to work with 15 architecture firms to create kits to kickstart the community. If there is a community perhaps it can be strengthened by empowering the community there to work together like an open market, a centre or dance floor; which is a place to dance outside with a roof. If we do projects for non-profit like in Africa, to build schools, there’s a lot of projects like that that are also needed in Sweden, and opportunities to do temporary things in Sweden. We feel like we need to be bottom-up when we plan, and one way would be just to let communities use leftover space so you use it temporarily, this is something we pushed quite a lot. I would say we don’t have the answer or key to how to do this in Sweden, but when we work in urban planning, it’s really about how to connect all the neighborhoods more so they are not isolated. It’s through infrastructure, streets, devices like schools and community centres with social spaces to meet and discuss. I don’t know over at your place, but over here Black lives matter was a big thing, which was terrible, but it was needed (a sad side of the story), but it went well in the sense that the police force and the political level met with the demonstrators and had a dialogue. But the sad thing was that a protest was still needed even though Sweden is thought to have reached so far, but I think the positive side is that we try.\nQ5: As an architect, you always have an aim at the start of the project on how your design contributes to the context, the city, and the community that uses it. There is a rigorous design process to achieve this aim, from understanding the programme and users to developing a design concept and assessment of details. For both completed and ongoing projects, how do you assess the level of success of achieving these goals? What makes a project more (or less) successful to you?\nUsually a successful concept is one where you can satisfy the cities’ municipal needs and satisfy the client’s commercial needs. In the best of worlds that’s not really the conflict, because you want a space like this to be popular and used, and the retail, restaurants and hotels to be popular as well. So I think the key is coming up with arguments and strategies that are beneficial to as many parties as possible. If the scope is too narrow here in Sweden, a lot of projects stop in the planning process, sometimes due to financial difficulties, but also because nobody really wants to go ahead with the planning and design. In general, of course, we never decide anything as architects, but if we are having a successful day, we can still frame the projects so it really is about the interests we like; sustainable developments and a better place for people and the planet. There’s always a struggle and work needed to get there. We as architects always try to do very sustainable projects, and it is very hard to hit all these targets but hopefully you get to steer the project’s position to a positive direction although you did not hit all your targets of sustainability, livability or inclusion etc.\n","date":"08","image":"images/post/09_Kjellander_2.jpg","month":"Feb","permalink":"/post/kjellander_sjoberg/","tags":["Citizen Participation","Ownership"],"title":"Kjellander Sjöberg"},{"categories":["casestudies"],"contents":"  Project Name: Renovation of Ruhehe Primary School Location: Ruhengeri (or Musanze), Rwanda Date Designed: 2015\nDate Completed: 2018 Size: 560 sqm\nClient: Musanze District Ministry of Education Programme: Education MASS Design Group\nMASS consists of a team of over 120+ architects, landscape architects, engineers, builders, furniture designers, writers, filmmakers, and researchers representing 20 countries across the globe.

In 2015, to improve education standards and enrolment in the Musanze district, the school was renovated with locally sourced materials and traditional crafts as a sustainable model of educational infrastructure that can be scaled across Rwanda. Renovation of Ruhehe Primary School\n Interview with DORAN Kelly of MASS Design Group\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nYes. We are at the pivotal point in human history. Buildings account for 40% of annual consumption of energy. 10% is from construction. If we need to get to 0 in 30 years, as students, we have to think about what we can do to tackle that problem. How can I half the impact of current construction? How can I half operational footprint of existing buildings? It is a life work than spans across 30 years.\nThere are different answers across different contexts and you have to engage with your context. What if buildings stopped right now, where would you start? These should also be addressed and taught in school.\n2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nRwanda did an amazing job and construction resumed about 2 months ago because of how proactive the government was in keeping the cases low. Precautions were done well, and the firm worked with contractors to put together guidelines for the workforce to practise. Immersion continued, with over 600 people being involved. This goes to show the importance of the authority in ensuring guidelines were met.\nIn the States, most of the work is in design phase . Immersion is performed virtually on Zoom instead. Although it is a different approach of getting to know people, we are still able to reach out and perform the tasks, but on another platform. 3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?\nThe book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth: Story of the Future by David Wallace Wills’ changed the way I think everyday. If we want to survive on this planet, we have to behave a certain way, what can I do everyday to make that happen? To continue the ways we design buildings would be irresponsible. How do we design to hald emissions? That will involve the consutrction details, materials you use, systems you employ and so on. In current buildings, light does not reach into the rooms and ventilation is not optimal. That is indicative of bad architecture. That’s where we should start thinking about how to change the built environment.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: I understand that you first joined MASS in 2014 to lead the office in Kigali and are currently based in London overseeing works across the globe. I would love to know the different challenges you faced when leading these offices and how did you overcome them given their different contexts?\nThe approach has been consistent in terms of how we engage with people. We started our conversation in Rwanda with lessons learnt brought out to everywhere else. No great difference observed, mainly dealing with people and context with different opportunities. As designers, we figure out who the constellation of people are and what the constraints of the place are - how do you work with that?\nA lesson learnt from East Africa was how to work with the constraints in under-developed or less industrialised communities especially in terms of construction. Things that we often used are now difficult to be obtained and that opened my eyes about how there are things and materials we can use - why are we still not engaging them?\nThe way I practised previously never considered where materials came from, working with assumptions instead.\nQ2: MASS has also expressed keen interest in the environment. How can similar techniques be applied to modern city planning, perhaps in communities with little natural resources, to spur future developments in an environmentally conscious way?\nI think the question lays out certain assumptions we have. What if we flip about the question - what if we no longer are able to import anything? How did a country like Singapore build itself a century ago? Instead, the question that should be asked is, ‘At what point have we become so reliant on importation? Was it ever autonomous?’ There is actually a connection, in that Rwanda is Singapore-Africa in that both are highly densely populated, small with not a lot of resources, and it may seem to be that there exist a need to rely on importation but that is not really the case for Rwanda.\nQ3: How has representing the firm as non-profit affected the workflow and the image of MASS? Has this more inclusive model and sustainable material culture help in sustain the architectural practice as well?\nIt is our responsibility to make sure that projects are sustainable. That would mean to spend a lot of time looking at socio-economic construction, the ecological impact, the emboded carbon to understand our material selection.\nThere was a recent relevation that the first act of construction is almost as important as the energy efficiency and operational life of a building. Hence, it is of no surprise that resources like stones sourced locally as opposed to cement block with higher carbon materials are going to achieve a better typological result. This achieves the socio-economic impact and proves the success of the intent, which is to be far more sustainable. Architecture needs to be a regional practice again so if you are sourcing something when you do not know where it comes from, then you probably should not source and use it.\nIn terms of non-profit and financial sustainability, it provides flexibility as we can raise money to support work and conduct research. For us, we have discretionary funds which supports the capitalism fund and this constitutes the biggest part of a non-profit organisation. This allows us to initiate projects and reach out to firms to get it on the ground. That is different with a for-profit firm, where firms do it for people who can afford their services and they engage in private developers in such projects. For non-profit firms, it is more about donating their services and donating it to people who really need to use them but are unable to afford them.\nA sign of success would be to see more non-profits around the world.\nQ4: Was there a reason why a bottom-up approach was undertaken by MASS?\nIt was mostly inspired by the first project we did, which is the Butaro Hospital. The design and built process was long, where we sat down with the doctors and community and saw what they needed. Refining was performed and we made the field guide openly accessible on our website. Process of immersion came with context, in hopes that others will engage in the same model because it has worked.\nMany big architectural firms follow a top-down body and capital. Although the Ruhehe Primary School project looks more ground-up, it also received a lot of fundings from outside organisation but the process of enaging with the students, teachers and parents is still largely bottom-up. If we do not engage with the end users, who are you designing for? One would simply be designing based on the assumptions or from feedback that other results have gathered and that the entire stakeholders are not properly represented, reading projects as poor or incorrect. It is hence important to engage right from the start, ensuring continuation of projects. The more care and attention you give it, the more it will retain itself.\nQ5: Is there another possibility, where profits and community engagement can both be achieved?\nYes! I think there lies a misconception. We feel that all architects are non-profit, they just do not realise it. You need to be financially sustainable. Some projects gain profits while others do not. For non-profit firms, we take that and reinvest it back into the community instead of keeping them as dividends. There is a 3-step approach that firms should employ. Firstly, who is the community, what are their needs and what is the project? Secondly, where is the funding? Thirdly, how do you use the constraints and apply it to the concept and design?\nConstruction is expensive. Architects and designers should think about how to bring them together. If the design will cost a certain amount, raise some funds for it. Within that funding consists of your fee. If you spend time to figure out these two things, you can work out the profit at the end of the day. The only difference is that for non-profit firms, our work is mostly free, giving back to the community instead of keeping it.

ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nI think young architects because we live in such uncertain times right now. I’m really concerned about people who are getting into the profession right now because it’s so unclear what we’re dealing with. What are the implications to the built environment, the natural environment where people still want to live in cities where people not want to, So I think that is a very unstable situation, but I think also architects are trained. Architects should be trained. It’s something that is supposed to be in this profession the ability to deal with situations that are not clear. I think it’s a worrying time, but at the same time, architects have very strong and have the skills and the mindset to face something that is not well-defined, that’s unclear or uncertain. China definitely played a strong role in that you look at a lot of these buildings, like the bird’s nest, for example it’s rarely used. It’s a sitting skeleton there without a use. That’s an example of something that’s not so flexing. And no matter how you conceive of a project, it is uncertain I’m sure all of these buildings were thought of as buildings that would last for quite a while functioning a certain way. but today I think that is really hard to say, but in fact that is the reality. There’s nothing certain we don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I think architecture can help us deal with that situation, but at the same time, provide us comfort to help us sort of appreciate, the current moment as well. To help us build relationships and to appreciate these experiences. I think we can do that. I think that the way we approach architecture Is not so typical. I think it’s very difficult. I would say, I wouldn’t think that people should follow our path, but I think people should keep an open mind, on how you, how you approach design and architecture and I think of the way that we’ve approached our practice. I think we do have tools to deal with whatever comes next with this covert situation. I’m really caught in the middle of a lot of uncertainty, there’s this kind of crazy political situation between the China and the US. I’m Chinese American, I’m literally sort of in between these places. COVID was serious in China, and now it’s not as much, but then as announced really serious in the US I have no idea what’s going to happen. These are our times, uh, but I think the way that I I’m happy that the way that we approached our work for me feels like there’s a way for me to link that. Our past work with what could come up in the future. And I think there is, and it’s showing up, you know, we’ve been getting projects where people are interested in. like that hospital that was built in 10 days. before COVID we actually built a business school using the same system and we’ve just built another school, using that system. These approaches are approaches that are now extremely valued. People are much more aware of, and it’s relevant to what we have right now. 2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nI think the term social architecture is not something that’s I feel has been so commonly used. There’s the Venice Biennale a few years ago that the focus on this were social issues. I find in academia, I’ve taught at MIT and Harvard and, I feel like social issues that surround architecture are not dealt with in such a significant way and not in such a direct way, but I think now with COVID, it’s impossible to talk about architecture without thinking of social implications. That’s my sense it’s a little bit early, here in the States where we’re dealing with lots of the racial issues, and imagine being an architect that doesn’t have a way of talking about race and segregation and public health. Now these are issues that we don’t normally think are related to architecture, but if we think about cities and housees, why do people live in one place and not another, you start to also see cities are divided and it’s segregated through space. Our way of dealing with COVID is through space, right? What’s the solution? We need to have a base between us, but also who are the people that I can afford to have the space and who are the people who can’t afford to have space. This is a social issue, it’s an architectural issue and you can start to understand how portions of society can be excluded from the benefits of living in different places .Today we have more opportunity to talk about that dimension of architecture than before. It’s unfortunate that we have this situation of course but I hope that we’ll be able to talk about this in a more significant way. 3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?\n- Interview Transcript\nQ1: We know that People’s Architecture office’s motto is designing for the masses, what inspired you and how did this notion come about?\nArchitecture has powerful ways in which architecture shapes society and vice versa the society shapes architecture. Architecture has a very strong role in the way that we create the community. When I started working and when I had the chance to start office with my two partners, what direction should we take for our firm. Initially, we had no projects and when started the office in Beijing, and started looking around we realised that there weren’t many offices that are thinking around people especially in China. It was a reaction to the time. We were in China, the word ppl is something we thought could really inspire a stronger role for architecture. The word people has lost a lot of meaning, shape the practice. Personally, born and raised in US, refugees from china. There are a lot of ways that the city has shaped my life and heritage, these special aspects, affected how I thinks about architecture. Trained as a product designer (furniture) PD more direct way of connecting with ppl, there is a very strong art prog in Grad school, focus on the intervention in public, and dealing with social issues. I wanted to find more meaning in this work that I really love to do.\nQ2: We realised in many of your intervention projects there is a use of these proprietary prefabricated panels. Can you share more specifics on the material, technology and the way you conceive the design for perhaps longer-term projects or towards larger goals?\nIn terms of prefab band modular there is just any different types. What we needed to do in the neighbourhood that we were working in in china this is part of the reason why it is important to dwell deep into the context was that we couldn’t lift a big shipping container into this dense location it was just not possible. And we started out by building inside buildings, so we didn’t want to take apart or destroy anything. It was meant to be something that was slipped into something that was existing. And also, it was meant to be flexible. If later on if you need to get rid of it, you could or if people want to relocate you can take your house with you. Those are some fundamental concepts that were interesting. Also, you couldn’t bring in any heavy equipment, so it was important that you could do this by hand. This material does allow to that. The module is only the size of a door. To assemble this, you only need one tool, so the connection is built into the panel. The panel the material is very unique, it is high density polyurethane insulation it is many times more energy efficient than other materials usually used in buildings. The reason why this is possible is because this is a mass produced product, something that is not made by hand. Q3: Many projects such as the plugin house seems to be focusing on addressing particular social / urban issues in Beijing, to what extent do you think it is applicable to Chinese cities in general? What other measures are needed for a more sustainable future of living?\nThat project started in Beijing in the courtyard houses in a specific context. We are very serious about focusing on the particular context in that location to not treat it as something that works everywhere. The ideas we have are those that are applicable to all kinds of location. Those are things that do not conflict. In terms of implementing it need to be specific to the location. Once we have done that we did take it to other cities, we have implemented in different context so, we done it in urban villages, in rural locations, and in US. For a slightly diff use to be built in backyard homes as a separate dwelling unit and I think a lot of these ideas can transfer. While at the same time we managed to work a specific way in that context.\nQ4: How does these installation projects come about, are they self-initiated or are most of them commissions from specific clients?\nWe have really tried to explore the idea of self-initiated projects. We explored that quite a lot. The plug-ins is a mix. It started out as a call from the government to think of a way to deal with the slum like conditions in Dashilan, Beijing. There were a lot of informal housing but at the same time very rich history and culture. It was an open call and we made the proposal and it was initially funded by the government. When we first started we tested this on vacant houses as we didn’t want to test on people’s home until it was something that was more developed. In the second year it was more developed and we worked with the locals and it became partially funded by them. After that the drive from the government paused, due to other complications. But the locals still came to us, at that point they just funded it themselves. Since than we felt that this is something that can be used in other places and there is enough interest in it so we put out a call for co-funding it in rural areas. However, in china there were some land use issues that make it very different to grow in scale, having a good amount of quantity. So we looked into the US, I had some time to relocate in the US for this fellowship. I made some good connections with the local government to see if we could implement these plug in houses in the US. So we brought a prototype at Harvard, use that to introduce the idea to people in the US. We also built another one at the Boston City Hall. These are all self-initiated, all the funding we found ourselves. Through that what we decided to do was to not treat it like an architecture project but to take a more entrepreneurial approach. We realised that it was very difficult to use this as an architectural project, we just do not have enough funding to do the research and development. We cannot really develop a product without more time and proper funding. So now the plug in house is a separate company registered in the state, we have investment and a manufacturing partner, we are producing for use as small housing but with a different type of policy that was necessary that we didn’t have in China. Q5: Many of PAO’s project tackle social issues and is aimed at promoting interactivity. Could you share with us on how these social interventions responds to the urban environment?\nOur approach with the plug in is to embrace what is already there. The word intervention is appropriate because we are intervening we are not replacing and we are not renewing it entirely, we are inserting. What we intend to do is to improve what is already there not replace. We also embrace all of the challenges that comes with what is retaining what is already there, we recognise the value of that. The social relationships that they have in these older communities is precious, if we get rid of that it will take generations to built up these relationships again and the culture that comes with it. If you were to go to these location it is what you would expect when you visit China as you can sense the sense of community and the history and the lifestyle there is very unique and have character. If you go to a new development, you can often feel like its just like any other place. That is not something that architecture can create, I can create an artificial Venice but it doesn’t not come with the life of Venice. The life of Venice is unique, I don’t think architecture can do that but I can improve on Venice. That is our approach for all the plugin projects for all the locations. That is a fundamental characteristic to this project.\nQ6: Some of PAO’s projects also involve art installations like the golden bubbles and the habitation modules. These projects like social statements so how do you approach these designs?\nA lot of the design approach in our plugin houses are shared with our art installation projects. We didn’t start off by calling these projects as art, we also did that work thinking that it is also architecture, sort of our brand of architecture. Our intention is similar, I will call these interventions because these projects slip into existing spaces. The try to draw in and take advantage of the social capital that is already there. People participate in these projects, they are never there for you to just look at. They allow people to not only engage with our pieces and will often times allow you to engage with other people in different way. Some of the golden bubbles were suspended between different floors and they work as these kaleidoscope type tubes. The purpose was to get strangers to interact. This is the type of interaction that is unique. That is a promise for a lot of architecture. You create spaces that encourage people to interact, people who not interact in another kind of situation. The plug-ins are similar, for example when we are building it in a vacant space, a space that could not be used typically, you are turning it into a space that people can occupy again. This new someone might be younger, allowing for interactions between generations and hopefully the tradition can continue for longer. Its an extension of the same thing. There is also certain type of temporarily, I think time is very important, we do not treat architecture to be something that permanent. I think most buildings are built are conceived that way, we think of the city as continually changing. The values, our culture our society it is constantly changing and shifting and you can see it now in the way many cities are trying to deal with COVID. You have to turn buildings into different things that they never Q7: In the recent project PAO has done on the Leping Social Entrepreneur Headquarter, there are a lot of green spaces that are integrated within the office, what are your views on environmental sustainability and how can we design for it to be one with the architecture?\nI have a pretty strong opinion about sustainability. I think a lot of times it’s used in a way that is not truly about sustainability, but more representing. We have used greenery in our projects and in different instances, the Leping foundation is one example. Although Leping foundation is be more about wellness, a way of working, that is that’s healthy and balanced. When we talk about sustainability it’s technology dependent, I think that’s not the realm of it because we’re just adding technology. Adding solar panels and such, I think is something that we should do. But I would urge people to think about sustainability in a larger sense, in a more macro sense. Because no matter how green my building is, most of the buildings are not built that way. Looking at vernacular architecture in the world, they’re extremely sustainable because they were built to be connected with the environment and also there was a lifestyle to work with that. Today, our lifestyles don’t work well with a sustainable city, the way that we’ve approached architecture is adaptive. That’s where we’ve taking advantage of what’s existing instead of tearing everything down. Rebuilding, I think of that as being extremely sustainable. It’s how cities have developed and that’s how cities should continue to develop. You don’t have to always start from scratch. The adaptability is sustainable because when you come up with a building, you think of it as being permanent, but a few years later it’s not relevant anymore and its torn down, that’s a lot of waste. If part of our building is not relevant anymore or say it’s too small I can take out a few of the panels or add more, that way I don’t need to take down the entire building. Even if I do need to take down a building, it’s easy. I just take it apart and I can move it. I can reuse it. A reusable architecture is also something that is not common. Sustainability should be considered in relation to wellness and social issues such as class because you usually have extremely poor people who are living in a very sustainable way or you have extremely rich, living in very expensive buildings that are supposedly sustainable, but in between you have most of the world that is built in a not sustainable, connected with a lifestyle that is not very sustainable. The US is probably the best example of unsustainable society. Singapore is a great example of a place that has very good ways of dealing with certain issues, for example, housing like public housing, I wish we could take those lessons and expand them to large countries.

William of WTA Architecture and Design\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nStudents now are living in a very interesting time. Even the pandemic might introduce a lot of change to how we do things. There is a Chinese saying, ‘Opportunity is a crisis’. This is really an opportunity for architecture because everyone is willing to try new things. If you look at architecture today, there is a certain amount of diversity in thinking which is good as that means that maybe the dominant theme of architecture is this kind of embrace of diversity. We are trying to accept the differences as people, our uniqueness as individuals. I think that it is a good thing for architecture in terms of being more willing to explore more things. This also means that students must be willing to make mistakes. To develop things, we need to be willing to experiment and explore. I always feel like there are two things for me to keep the passion of architecture alive. It is this search for discovery. There is also this romanticisation of the impossible because a lot of times you get discouraged with your work, we stumble and fall. The frustrations, the failures, all these can enrich your ideas. Especially students, they should be aware about this. I used to tell my students that they can be the ones failing in class, but they might be doing the best. At least, they not what does not work. I think we have to embrace failure as a way to learn. That will be my advice.\n2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nIn WTA, we are trying to make these public spaces more accessible rather than more distinct. I think that public space always adopted the character of buildings, monolithic and very dominant, because one of the main reasons for classical architecture is for it to project power and that has kind of stayed with the architecture of public space for a long time. But I think we are trying to break that down and fragment this and trying to say that for public space, the character has to be about openness and not about control of power.I think our office spaces needs to be more open and not have sealed environments. That is something that is needed to be discussed. We should not seal ourselves off from everyone. I think that open spaces are still the safest at the end off the day and we need more access to these, to have more breathable spaces. One of our projects now is looking into how we can reinforce community bubbles. One of the problems with COVID-19 or any pandemic that comes along is that there is a certain spread from one community to another. This is because people congregate especially in big cities there are certain pressure points for example, shopping malls, churches and markets. Going along with social architecture ideas, we feel that we have to make these facilities locally, meaning, a certain neighbourhood or community should have access to a certain level of public amenities that would probably lessened the distance of the journey, especially now when there is not much public transport to these big centres where everyone is meeting. We are trying to mitigate inter-community transmission of the virus.\n3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?\nI read a lot of fantasy books and a lot of comic books. I think fiction is very good for architects. It allows you to imagine and explore and see different worlds which is important for architects. If you are going to go with fantasy, I will have to start with Tolkein. But at the end of the day, I think read ‘The Sandman’. I always like ‘The Sandman’. I have always enjoyed that comic. I am a big comic collector. One of the things I have always tried to react against are books like ‘Towards a New Architecture’ by Le Corbusier. I think many of our architecture today is a reflection of his ideas and I want to rail against it. So for you to be able to react against what you do not want, you have to know about it. Hence, I think it is one of those books that people should read because when I was reading it, it kind of instilled a certain passion in me to go against it. It should be that book for you to challenge yourself on how to go against this very industrial way of looking at architecture and I always tried to fight against this very mechanised idea of about how architecture can just be cookie cutter and can be manufactured. That is a very big book to read to inform yourself. Go read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand if you are not passionate enough! Go to the library and get a copy, every architect should read that.\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: How did you become interested in social architecture and social impact? What inspired you to address social issues through architecture?\nThere is a couple of things. Firstly, I studied in NUS about 8 years ago. I think back then, I realized the difference between Singapore and our more capitalist and open system. Hence, one of the things that really got me thinking was how do you work and make our system work because it is so open. In a way, the public sector which is the government is a little weak and so, we felt like it has to be more of a social response by people from private sector, to be able to make some change in terms of how we can improve our public spaces or civic facilities here. I grew up in downtown Manila and that area is really a very dense space. In fact, Tondo is a basically the densest political unit in the world and I think Manila is denser than Mumbay also. One of the things that you notice there immediately is that there are always people everywhere you go and so, a lot of the things in fact happen on the streets. Therefore, this has always had an impact on me on how the streets are basically the public space. That got me to study in terms what we can do to help this, or maybe how this can even inform our work. Questions start to appear. Why the streets? Why do we always use our streets for various public activities? These are some of the questions that spurred me to think of how we can better advocate and create public spaces in our country.\nQ2: What kind of challenges your team encounter in such urban intervention projects?\nI think the biggest challenge we always have is trying to convince people and get them to buy into what you are trying to do because it is something that is hard to explain and new. Anything that is new always have a certain push back against it. I think the biggest challenge is trying to convince the various stakeholders such as the local government, the local barangay officials and even the local businesses establishment whom we try to convince how certain interventions can be positive for whatever they are interested in. That is the biggest challenge.\nIt’s not just government regulations. You need people to buy in what you are trying to do, you ned to convince people, convince the various stakeholders. I think the public participation part is always challenging because you need them to agree to what you are trying to propose. Also, it is difficult to convince people into something that they have not experience or seen.\nQ3: What drove you and your team to conceptualize Book Stop aside from your architectural firm’s jobs?\nWe were invited to join a competition to design a library. The library location is like a touristic area and so, they were trying to argue that you should be able to catch people that are just passing by, and act like a net to attract people to visit this library. The rationale was that, people these days do not go to libraries anymore. They do not read books. They always read things online on their laptops or mobile phone. Hence, this was one of the things we wanted to change. I still love to read books and maybe, it is not the book themselves that are deterring people from going into the library but because the libraries are not accessible. I started to think of the difference with our desktop computers and our mobile phones. We always have our mobile phones with us, simply because they are with us wherever we go. Hence, I think accessibility was one of the key things we need to focus on in terms of why like libraries do not seem to function as what we want them to be. Therefore, we started to do this project as we wanted to prove the point. It was actually an initiative and an experiment. We were just trying to get data. When we put the library here, are people going to come? Hence, we were moved the Book Stop to different areas of the city. I think we have about 12 locations, just trying to get the data in terms of foot traffic, how much turnover we are going to get per location per day.\nQ4: In the Book Stop Project, can you share with us your design workflow that led you to propose the idea to create a network of localized libraries?\nThe way I think how our studio works in terms of workflow, is whenever we get a project, whether it is a library, shopping mall or even a condo building, we try to break it down to its first principles. We try to break it down to its original idea or to its basic form. For example, our shopping mall is just a market, a market is a bazaar, a bazaar is a forum. It is basically an area where people meet, so we started to offer goods and services and that is how the market develop. We try to break it down to its first principle. For the library, we thought that what people need is a space. Hence, we need to define a space, because that is what makes it architecture. Then, you need shelves for books to store, you need shelter for people and maybe some seating. Hence, we thought that if we put this in a park, that would be a perfect setting, because you can just get the books and read them in a park. If you look at the first libraries in Greece, they were just storage spaces for books, because at the end of the day, they do not have electricity, so they read outdoors. The library was like just a storage for scrolls. That was how we kind of derived the idea of the Book Stop.\nQ5: How did you make it inclusive and barrier-free? How did you capitalise on it?\nWell, the Book Stop has no librarian and security. You bring a book and you can take one book back home. It pretty much works on a system of trust. The idea is that, you give and take. I think that is how it works. Since it is very open, it is almost like a communal system of security. It is like securing a space by making it more open and making it visible to everyone. The public itself is what keeping it safe. How we capitalise on it? It has pretty much led to a lot of work we are currently doing. I think the Book Stop was a very strong starting point in terms of like how we have proceeded from our architecture from that point on. It is maybe not the beginning, but it was a good inflection point in terms of how we started doing architecture in our office and how bring all these certain lessons that we got from the Book Stop Project. It informed our architecture from then and until now actually.\nQ6: Can you further explain the idea of frictionless system whereby you seek an architecture that is completely open and non-restrictive? How does this help to bring people closer together?\nThat was actually the main idea that we really work out from the Book Stop Project that were applicable for architecture. The main idea is that there is a lot of public space that is discriminating a big part of our population. So how does public space discriminate against people? I think for one, if you are not dressed properly, there are certain places that you could not go in. Especially here in the Philippines, a big part of the population does not have access to library. Secondly, you need to bring your public ID (identification card), which a lot of people do not have, especially those in the informal sector. Also, I think it discriminate against people who do not have time, who are too busy and do not have time to go to a library. It prohibits these people from enjoying these spaces or not being able to have access on the things we need, to have a more holistic lifestyle. We used this idea in a lot of our projects. For example, right after the Book Stop Project, we need a version of it for a Museo del Prado. If we can do it for a library, we can do it for a museum. The museum was also open. We placed it in parks and piazzas. The idea was for the art to become part of your daily life. When you are going to work or going back home, you pass by it and enjoy maybe 1 or 2 paintings. We are also building a stadium now. One of the problems in building a stadium is that they always turn into a concert venue. Especially in Philippines, we do not play football and baseball. The stadium will only be used once a year, when there is a parade or whatever. Hence, we felt that to open a stadium, we chopped off one side of the stadium and on that side, there is a park. The stadium becomes an extension of the park by allowing a free and open access to everyone. I think that idea was informed from the concept of the barrier-free design. We are also building a pedestrian bridge across the Pasig River right now. Unfortunately, Metro Manila is dissected by the Pasig River, but there is no single pedestrian bridge across the Pasig River. The idea for this bridge is to change how we perceive bridges in our country. I think most people now perceive bridges as crossing points, but we do not really experience the bridge itself, because the bridge has not become a pedestrian place. By building a pedestrian bridge, were allowing people to explore the river itself and appreciate it more. This also allows mobility for people without cars. We also built a shopping mall at Lipa, where it is not critical for Philippines. Hence, we tried to recreate certain streetscapes inside the shopping mall. If you look at the plan of the shopping mall, it is basically a slice. We have these certain streets that lead out to pocket openings, and then bigger piazzas and parks. The is the same idea of being completely open. No doors, no gates. It is a completely open shopping mall. We are also designing a city now. We are trying to do a masterplan from the bottom up approach in developing our cities. In Philippines, the cities are divided into barangays, so we wanted to do barangay masterplans and stitch it together for it to create a whole masterplan.\nQ7: Can the architecture be evolved to make them more suitable for today’s circumstance such as the COVID-19 pandemic? How do you think the COVID-19 pandemic will change your work in the future?\nArchitecture evolves regardless if we have this pandemic or not. I think change is a very big constant in architecture. We probably are one of the slowest arts to change simply because architecture takes so much time to build.Sometimes by the time you build something, the lifestyle might change. For example, the pandemic. Most of the buildings that are being built now or even after the pandemic were not design before the pandemic. Good architecture is very adaptive and so it tries to withstand these things. I think one of the differences between architects and engineers and why we really need architects in our society is that engineers are probably the best at finding solutions to any problem because engineers solve problems, but architects plan and project fir the future. Hence, for anything that involves a lot of change, that is where architects come in as we can project and plan.\nQ8: What is your latest project that relates to the COVID-19 pandemic?\nOur latest project is called the EQF. It is the Emergency Quarantine Facility that we are building now in our fight against COVID-19. In fact, these facilities were also built in Singapore. I think they built 3000 beds in the Singapore Turf Club. I think it is one of the few cases where the idea actually came from the Philippines to Singapore. It is a very good way in looking at how architects can fulfil our role in society. At that time, everybody in our country was lost and did not know what to do, but even now we are still lost. (Laughter) The response here was largely from us and it was something that brought together so many architects in our community. We were doing this together. The point is, why the EQFs were successful is because the plan is open source available online and that is really our idea. Social architecture extends to not just our work but also for our practice. You know a lot of offices have restrict access to files. Our office is open access. No files are restricted. My staff probably has access to more files than me so that is the way I see architecture. You must practice what you preach. We are an open book.\n","date":"11","image":"images/post/12_WTA Architecture and Design_01.jpg","month":"Nov","permalink":"/post/wta/","tags":["Citizen Participation","Urban Revitalisation"],"title":"WTA Architecture and Design Studio"},{"categories":["casestudies"],"contents":"  Project Name: St Josephs’ Nursing Home Location: Singapore, Singapore Date Designed: - Date Completed: 2017 Size: 22,022 sqm Client: Catholic Welfare Services Singapore Programme: Healthcare ABOUT SAA Architects\nSAA is a leading full-service architecture practice headquartered in Singapore. With over 50 years of design and built expertise, they are committed to the pursuit of excellence in the design and delivery of people-oriented architecture that connects communities with their urban environments.\nGuided by the core values of being Urbanistic, Humanistic, and Optimistic, their practice delivers projects that connect and engage seamlessly with the built environment; creating meaningful relationships by placing people and communities at the centre of their design.\nAt SAA, 200 multinational professionals collaborate closely with partners and clients to respond to design challenges in an increasingly complex, technology-driven world; bringing specialist expertise to the various sectors that they engage in.\nABOUT St Josephs’ Nursing Home\nSt. Joseph’s Home is a nursing home for the aged in a densely populated residential district in the West of Singapore. After the renovation of the nursing home, the amenities were greatly improved, with an increment from 139 beds to 412 beds. The revamped facilities also include an improved landscape design that encourages interactivity and improves the quality of living in the nursing home.\nSt Josephs’ Nursing Home\n Interview with LEONG Michael of SAA Architects\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nI have been an architect for 20 years by now. So I practiced for about seven years in public agency, and the rest of it was in the private sector. And so I’ve seen both sides of the practice and both from a government agency and as a private practicing architect, and I think something that is quite universal to all of us as architects.\nAs far as somebody who has worked 20 years as an architect is concerned. It is actually very important for you to not just see it as a job. Okay. So over my 20 years both in the private and public sector, I have seen many friends and colleagues who have in a way through in the tower, okay had decided that architecture is not your cup of tea.\nAnd these architects are people who have studied for five, six years, even after registering and finally come to a conclusion that this is not what they want to do. So there are many other alternatives for them to choose from. I find that it is a pity when we started out being very aspirational. And so I find that a great misfortune because you will have devoted many years of your life pursuing something that you definitely believe in and therefore you’re here. And I think a lot of such cases are avoidable. And I feel that the issue sometimes is that when we look at Architecture as a job or sometimes we use the word day job, right? It is actually not going to be worth the while. You will find that it is going to be very backbreaking, it is going to be quite heartbreaking sometimes also. And a lot of effort that you put in, maybe just torn into pieces, just like that. If you think that your crits in school are bad enough, wait till you come out and practice. So, as long as we continue to think that it is a job that we do in order to make a living, it is not going to work because the nature of Architecture is that there is such an important element of perhaps the word I would use is Mission that there is a sense of mission in architecture that, if you do not get into depth, you will not be able to find the energy to sustain you. 2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nI don’t really have much vision about it. In fact, I think the whole vision is quite blurred now. And I think I have more concerns and worries about the whole situation rather than the vision but I will say that there is always room for us to change a concern into an opportunity and my concern is mainly that because it has become so evident that human interaction actually can be cut out from our meetings and the way we do things and all that. This kind of meeting that we are having now, it has become the norm. And it has become something that continues to pull people further and further away from each other physically, even though you can talk virtually, but it is never going to be the same as a face to face interaction. And young people are already finding it harder to interact with one another, and to read body language and to be able to see the nuances in human interaction compared to the older generation. My generation would find it harder than my parents’ generation, because we will have a lot more technology than they do, but younger generations like you will be a lot more technically savvy than my generation. So you would actually have more challenges in terms of the ability to interact with people as an overall statement as a general trend. Perhaps some individuals are different. So, I will say that, in this COVID situation, what everybody has become more and more used to is this kind of virtual interaction and my worry about that is that we start to get used to it. And we are desensitized, from the lack of human interaction. And we, we start to lose what defines us as human beings which is actually the relationship that we have with each other and this relationship between human beings is not just a virtual relationship, it has to be a complete and holistic person to person relationship. And that I find is something that is more and more disturbing to me, especially for young children, I have two young kids and actually not that young, one’s a teenager and sometimes I observe how they interact with people and I realized that there is already a difference between different generations. So, that would become a handicap in a real life situation. When you go out to the world and when you try to solve problems with the builders on site, on projects, or in any kind of situation that you will find in life. You will not be able to solve them by just having very good virtual skills and being tech savvy. It’s all about how do you persuade one another? How do you give and take? How do you accept each other’s views? Things like that is actually something that will have to be honed over a long period of time, through human interaction. And that’s, that’s my worry. But I feel that it is also possible to think about how we take advantage of it, in the sense that we have so much technology now, we have a better control of technology. Is it not possible that we can use this technology to work less and live more? Interview Transcript\nQ1: You have completed a variety of projects from big commercial malls, public and private residential projects, nursing homes, MRT stations, what is your design philosophy towards your projects? And what do you think are the different impacts of these projects on the community?\nSAA is involved in a large variety of projects and each project has a very specific requirement, and each client also has a very specific focus that they would like to achieve for the project. So you won’t have a one size fits all situation as every project has its own needs and challenges. What I try to always achieve is to create spaces that make people want to go back over and over again. What defines this kind of space is something that is quite universal, that is the comfort that people can find when they go to a space. Comfort is not only physical, it is also psychological. When we talk about psychological comfort, it is not found in all type of spaces. I think those spaces that people always feel attracted to, and want to return to are those with a lot of life and a lot of people that you can interact with. There’s a strong sense of community. There’s also generally a lot of nature that instinctively draws people to it. Comfort is a simple word, but not something simple to achieve. If you’re talking about public spaces, there isn’t really an owner to the space. It is something that belongs to everybody. Anybody can actually go there and use the facility if they feel like it.\nHowever, some public spaces work better than others because there is a sense of ownership in the people who use them. Ownership makes the key difference between successful public spaces and those that don’t work so well. So the question to ask is, how do you get people to get a sense of ownership to the public space? If you just put yourself in the shoes of a visitor to two different public squares, and one is more attractive and makes you feel more comfortable than the other. You will feel that you want to go back to the one that gives you more comfort, and you will want to always ensure that this level of comfort is preserved there. Therefore, you have an ownership of that space. When you see that there is rubbish on the floor, you will feel more inclined to pick it up. When you see that something is damaged, you feel more inclined to call the manager to come in and repair it, because you are the one using it, and you want to make sure that when you come back, you always get to enjoy it. So that’s what I mean by an ownership of a public space. What we need to do is to design something that is comfortable and attractive enough so that people feel that they own the space and therefore know that space will continue to be nice and attractive for everybody to come. Q2: What are some ways to give back to the community when you design these spaces?\nI think giving back to the community is something that not all projects are able to do to the same extent. The larger the project, the greater the impact on the company and community. A lot of our projects that we do in SAA, actually fall within that category because they are genuinely quite large and they have a lot of different users. One of the things that we need to be careful about when we introduce a new project especially a large one is to make sure that it will not create a negative impact on the existing urban fabric. That sometimes happens when you have a shopping mall that comes in and actually soaks up the entire business of the entire area. The smaller businesses that have been there for a long time start to lose their customers. It is because they are cut off from the people that used to come to their shops, and nobody visits the shop anymore. Eventually they might go out of business. So, when we introduce a big development like this, one of the very important thing is to make sure that we are always able to still allow the existing businesses and existing communities to go on and continue to do what they have been doing, in fact, maybe do even better than what they had before because you are bringing in more life. It makes a very big difference by the way we design them, by the way we connect to the existing developments. What is also quite important to think about is to make sure that within the project that you are doing, there are different types of spaces in which the commercial and non commercial activity can coexist. What that means is that you don’t always feel that you have to pay or you have to spend money in order to come and use this space. There are spaces where anybody can just feel very free to go to, and that’s actually very much about giving back to the community. Because when we talk about a community, it is a group of people who may not want to always spend money every time you enter into your building. They may just want to be there to perhaps find a quiet place to read a book or to be walking the dog or to meet up with friends. So we must design spaces for this kind of very casual and informal activity to take place while not attracting undesirable social behavior. That is how we can give back to the community. But again it takes a lot of thinking to find that balance.\nQ3: St. Joseph Nursing Home was one of the first Intergenerational facilities in Singapore. Were there any learning points from designing the Intergenerational facilities in the Home?\nSt. Joseph Nursing home is run by one of the Canossian Sisters. It is a religious organization and it is very much in their ethos to care about the dignity of the elderly. So, they are very progressive in exploring ways to achieve that intent. Bringing children into their environment in what we sometimes call intergenerational care is something that is quite unheard of in Singapore because of the way nursing homes were previously set up and operated. This is not something that is commonly seen, in fact it has never been seen before. The equipments like those in the playground were specially designed for somebody sitting in a wheelchair and a child to play side by side. There was one that is a basketball hoop that somebody on the wheelchair can throw at and there is also space for a child to do that together. Then there are things that see-saw and all that, which are done solely for the purpose of bringing different generations together. Other than that, there are also spaces where we allow activities that sometimes are quite large in nature because if you have young people coming, children coming in and you have elderly, who are a little bit less mobile, you actually need to create a lot of space for these activities to take place because of maneuvering space and all that. So that kind of spatial consideration is important. We also learnt that we have to be careful in training or educating the young people on interacting with the elderly. For instance, what the sisters do in St. Joseph Home, when they bring the young people to visit the seniors right is to tell them that you need to sanitize your hands before you go and visit uncles and aunties. That is very different from telling them that, “Okay, now that you have visited uncles and aunties, go and sanitize your hands”. It has a completely different effect. If you ask them to sanitize their hands before that, it shows that they need to be caring for the uncles and aunties and cannot spread any viruses to them, because we do not want them to get sick. But if you ask them to sanitize their hands after, that means you are telling them that there may be some diseases that the uncles and aunties might have, so you better sanitize after you have visited them. So we learn small things like that, sometimes may not be architectural in nature. But I think design is not just architecture. Design goes beyond that. As a designer, you need to think of how a space is used, how you program the space, and how you work with the users. What kind of mindsets do you want to help them to cultivate? I think all these are actually very important parts of the overall success of the space, not just the hardware itself.\nQ4: Moving on to questions on the St. Joseph nursing home. We wanted to know more about what was the driver behind the design in terms of form or in terms of the programs that you guys are introducing, and what were the stakeholders’ involvement in that project? Were there any opinions taken to decide on design decisions you made?\nSo the St. Joseph home or SGH project is a very interesting one that we were quite attached to. And we feel that there’s a lot of very good lessons that we have learned from it. In fact, when it all started, we were brought to the previous site, which was a single story nursing home, a very beautiful site. And we went there and the managers brought us around, showed us how they operate the site, how they allow the residents to use the spaces around the very beautiful garden setting. There was this large quadrangle which is in the middle and there’s lots of planting, there is a very nice naturally ventilated walkway that goes around it. And you can actually roam around and you can actually move around quite freely as a resident or as visitors. So, that’s what I saw when I went to the site and started looking and thinking about how we approach the design of this space. The design brief was, however, very challenging, we needed to increase the number of beds by about three times of what it was, which is actually a very tall order. Increasing three times normally would mean that you have to build upwards and from a single storey building, what we needed to do was to start considering how to stack it up to like a five or seven six storey building. And that was the design constraint that we were given but at the same time, that was also the opportunity for us to turn into something interesting. So, if you ask what is the driver behind the project, I will say that the driver is a simple question of how can we retain this experience of being on the ground, up into the sky. And that I found out was actually very important for somebody who is staying in a nursing home. There are a couple of things that are the hallmarks of failure of a nursing home. And one of it is actually the inability to move around. So the lack of mobility will result in things like boredom. Because if you’re always stuck on your wheelchair in a corner on a bed and you can’t move, you’re always going to be looking at the ceiling or you’re going to be looking at, perhaps a window if you’re lucky, but you’re always going to be looking at the same thing. And the problem of being in a nursing home is that there is a lack of variety of experience for the person. And when you are actually limited in terms of what you can see and what you can experience, your sense of life starts to go away. And that is one of the main issues of a nursing home. And therefore what we wanted to do on day one was really to find ways to allow the residents to be able to move around, no matter which floor they’re on. And if you have done some research about the project, you will have noticed that there is actually a garden that loops around on every floor of the nursing home, no matter which floor you’re on and this encourages the residents to actually continue to walk around the rooms, where they live on, and that is actually very important in helping them to maintain a sense of life and a level of energy that is very important for upkeeping the health that they have. So, I will say that, this is something that has been driving the project and we managed to actually do it quite effectively, I would say, and therefore, I think that’s something that the owners are also quite happy about. So there were some workshops that were conducted during the design process. And these are actually very useful because it is not a one way traffic. It’s actually a two way design process. So you talk to the users and you get insights from them, or issues that you deal with and you incorporate all these into your design before you finalize and get built. Very proud of the work that you’re doing, they must first be happy. If they are upset about the space that they have, if you can’t wait to get out of that place, then you cannot expect them to be doing a good piece of work in their day job. Generally, I think they’re all quite delighted by what they see over there. If there’s anything that I would have done differently, I think perhaps it’s actually to do more of what we have done which is the gardens that we have created. I would say that if I were to do anything, if I can do something differently, it is actually more of what we have done. So, to really extend the ability for people to walk, to be close to nature, even more than what there is now. Q5: Can you elaborate a little bit more about the workshop? Were the elderly involved as well?\nThere are all kinds of workshops that we actually conduct and workshops need to be an interactive process. And when we have workshops with other types of stakeholders in hospitals it involves a lot of people who will be actually operating the space. And if the elderly residents are unable to contribute to the workshop, we will need to involve people who work with them very closely. For example, their caregivers, the people who really know them very well, know what kind of problems they go through everyday. Then we involve these people in the workshop so that they can give you the input that is very real, very grounded so that when we design the space it is also designed with a lot of relevance to the actual end users. So it’s not easy to conduct a workshop. But if you have done it a few times, you sort of know, what is the best way to get insights from people. So there’s a certain technique of doing it, so that it becomes effective. And I think as architects, this is a tool that we are seeing ourselves using more and more over the years. And certainly in the years to come. If you want to be collaborative, if you want to be open minded about design solutions, then that is one very useful thing to adopt.\nQ6: One of the highlights of the St. Joseph Nursing home is the Green Belt that allows the elderly not only those who are bedridden, but also those who might not be able to go down and walk around the space, I think those are very good considerations that you had, other than those two groups of elderly, since there is a large spectrum of elderly, and St. Joseph Nursing home also has dementia patients. So, given that there is a whole spectrum of the elderly, what are the other challenges that you guys planned for or those that you faced when you are designing for the elderlies in various conditions?\nI think all of us will become old one day and, in fact, as a country Singapore is growing old very quickly. And if you look at some statistics, you will know that in 10 years time, about 25% or a quarter of people in Singapore are going to be more than 65 years old. Okay. So retirees will stop working. And when we start to become some we start to become older, a lot of us, we will start to lose our basic functional skills. And when we talk about this loss of skills, in the clinical language, they call it Activities of Daily Living, or ADL.\nThere are some basic ADLs that all of us are taking for granted, like changing your own clothes, feeding yourself, taking a cab or taking a MRT, simple things like that.\nSo we actually take some of these things for granted. And you’ll find that as we start to grow old, we will start to lose one or two of some of these functions.\nAnd these are actually very critical functions, that when we have it, we don’t really think about it. But when we lose them, it affects us tremendously. And you will not be able to imagine how badly it will affect you. If you lose the function of let’s say, going to the toilet yourself.\nYou can imagine that every time you need to pee, somebody must bring you to the toilet and help you. Can imagine that now if you have to go and brush your teeth. You can’t even do it yourself and somebody must help hold your hands to do it for you. This is the loss of ability to do basic things by ourselves,actually has a very massive emotional impact on people. And therefore, they become quite unhappy. A lot of times, you can sometimes look at an old person. You find that, in a way, when you look at a photograph of old people, you tend to see a lot of them being rather unhappy. And I think a lot of it is actually because they are starting to lose some of this ability to do things for themselves. And then that will bring you a lot of unhappiness. And I think, if you were to design spaces for elderly, and if you were to work on environments for elderly’s usage, you must not forget about that. And we must therefore, always look at how we can design the environment to make the elderly happy.\nHelp them to forget about some of these physical limitations that they have. Are there things that we can bring to the elderly environment in order to just give them an element of delight, or things that they enjoy in all kinds of environments, it doesn’t just have to be in the nursing home.\nAnd how do we bring in things that you think that will give them just a little bit more happiness in their life? And I think that is something very useful for us to remember. Like children. I don’t know whether you know, but the elderly people, they actually feel much better. In fact, their blood pressure will fall a little bit when they come into contact with young children.\nSo that is something that I have heard from many people, and I think it’s true. So there are many of such indicators that show that there are ways that you can actually bring certain elements into contact with old people. And that will help them to feel happier. And as Architects, as designers, definitely there’s a lot of room for us to introduce that in the environment that we design for them.\nQ7: Have you had a chance to go back to the St. Joseph nursing home to take a look at the spaces you had designed? And what are other than your own reflections were there feedback given on those spaces that you designed and looking from a critical point of view, is there anything that you would have done differently, looking back?\nYeah, I did go back a couple of times after completion, either to talk to the managers or to bring other visitors to take a look. And I would say that a lot of the time, they are always quite happy with the facilities that we have designed for them, there was actually once when we were walking around and it was I think, maybe 6.30 to 7pm around there definitely after 6, and as I was walking with the manager in the gardens on the ground floor, there was some nursing stuff who were hanging around in this dining area on the ground level. And so the manager was bringing me around, started to talk to them and said, “Eh, why are you guys still here? I thought your shift is over” because they have shifts right? It is a 24 hour thing. So “why are you guys still here, you know it is supposed to be the night shift now.” And then they smile and say “No, no, we like it here.” And, and the manager laughed and so he told me that sometimes what is very interesting is that the staff who work there, they will actually come early, and they would leave late, they wouldn’t come on the dot and leave on the dot. And sometimes what they tell him is that they find it actually to be nicer in the Home rather than outside. So they would actually spend more time in the Home rather than to go home early. Which is actually very heartening to hear.

ABOUT Kampung Kampus\nGround-Up Initiative (GUI) is a non-profit community, guided by the spirit of innovation, resilience and grounded leadership to demonstrate urban sustainability. With the power of community, GUI is building Kampung Kampus, a low-carbon footprint community campus, sited on a 2.6 hectares land plot in Yishun, Singapore. Kampung Kampus aims to be a role model in sustainable living and a School of Life; nurturing an eco-conscious community with the mind, the hands and the heart to be stewards of a more sustainable and happier future. Kampung Kampus\n __Insights and Takeaways__\n__1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?__\n- __2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?__\n- __3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?__\n- -- Interview with CAI Bingyu of Ground Up Initiative\nInterview Transcript\nQ1: Ever since you joined GUI, how has it affected or improved your life?\nI appreciate how things come together a lot more. One thing is the government (support). For instance, GUI has very limited resources, hence we have to do things very differently. In a way that is more creative, and we have to think out of the box and adapt. The situation changes frequently in a social enterprise like ours and I really appreciate what the country leaders are doing. For instance, during the Covid lockdown, operations at Orto had to close and this caused the pests like rats to come over to GUI where they ate all the produce. As such we now have a pest infestation and we had to adapt and improvise to counter against these unforeseen circumstances. It is not easy to run a nation/company well and there are a lot of things to consider. All of these really make me appreciate things more. In GUI, at the start I thought what I’ll be doing could save the world but at the end all I want is to be a better son, a better husband, a better father to my daughter, as well as a better person for this world. Q2: What is the process like for the initiation of Kampung Kampus, the idea and concept?\nThe idea came from our late chief, Mr Tay Lai Hock, after he travelled around the world. At his peak, when he was earning a lot of money for someone who had no education, he decided to drop everything and travel to see the world. After his trip, his life view changed. So he came back and decided to start something that can translate his thoughts into action and that was in the form of GUI. Through the years, he has been very mindful of grooming the next generation of leaders. He was trying to teach us how to do things in which he will reprimand us. But the most important thing was the values that he made us understood such that when the day the leadership is passed, GUI can still carry on and achieve its objective. Unfortunately, the chief’s passing was premature, but I am glad that the team that took over was stuck with him for some time hence we understood his philosophy and knew what he was trying to achieve. However, from then on, it was no longer about his philosophy because he is no longer the person driving it, but rather it must be something that the team currently believes in. The current team tweaked it a little bit – such that the framework is still similar to the old philosophy. The core values are still present, the 5Gs of: Gracious, Green, Giving, Grounded and Grateful and ultimately we want to drive a 5G community through the things we strongly believe in. Q3: You were mentioning earlier about how GUI managed to get sponsorship from a few parties, in regard to this could we ask you about some of the challenges and opportunities that GUI faced?\nWe have been very grateful to the government for their support. Of course, it was not like this at the start. At the beginning, we had to approach them with our idea and explain to them, show them, get them to come over, conduct the tours and convince them that GUI is something worth supporting. From there, we managed to get subsidies for our rental, so now we pay about 10k a month for this large piece of land. But through this agreement, we help to do the government’s work through an agency that brings in new citizens. We help them to integrate with the community, so it becomes an opportunity for us to connect with the residents. Of course, politics wise, we are in the Nee Soon GRC and we want to benefit the residents in the area too. Minister Shanmugam was one of those that helped us to champion this cause. We also want to work closely with the Chong Pang community and the newly elected MPs to tap on their connections and networks to be able to serve the numbers, being able to connect with the low income individuals as well as those families which needs help, we try to reach out to them. And through them (political and community outreach) the impact here can be stretched out to maximize as many people as possible. Q4: How was the land when it was taken over and how did GUI go about developing the assets it had?\nWe were very lucky, when we came over to this site, Bottle Tree Park already had farms here and there were viable farmlands just that it was not organic. We turned it into an organic farm which took us three years due to the application process as well as land surveyors coming down to check. So, I would say that our farms are okay, not super fertile as it is not meant to be a production farm but can be better. We had the asset of the existing physical infrastructure which were the road, the land and the kampung. There wasn’t much master planning to be done as all we were doing was replace the buildings or rather spaces that fit our uses. For example, the building we are in (heartquarters), previously had no windows and no aircon, that didn’t work with our uses, so we cleared it and had a new building built. Next came the issue of raising funds where we broke the masterplan into 3 phases. Currently, we are still progressing through half of the first phase. We had the benefit of existing infrastructure but there were lessons to be learned as some things could have been done much better. Q5: Has GUI considered shifting Kampung Kampus to an alternative location?\nDefinitely, this is actually a struggle for GUI. The late chief once mentioned that in Korea, the houses get passed down from generation to generation. As such there is a very strong attachment to it and people see the value of land very differently versus in Singapore. People look at land as investments rather than it being culture and family. Here in GUI, at one moment in time we are very reluctant to say that we can move anywhere. Over the years we have gradually moved towards how we can have real impact, and we have considered if we can move this to anywhere in Singapore. If this model is replicable and scalable and the impact is scalable, why don’t we try it out? It is a tough balance as we want to hold onto the land but at the same time there is so much more we can do if we move on from this location. I firmly believed that in GUI, it is not about the land but the people. We can move and the community can be built up again. It will be a struggle, but it is possible. Q6: If we were to shift Kampung Kampus to the heartland, how would that affect the kampung authenticity as well as the kampung community that GUI has been trying to cultivate?\nWe were trying to see how we could move to a hdb void deck but the idea couldn’t be fulfilled. Thankfully during this period, Professor Chong and Yohei from SUTD did the research on nature placemaking and with this research it became very powerful because we could prove that with an arbitary number of assets like trees, land and farms, we can guarantee that a certain amount of people will be mentally well, families that will be positively influenced, people who will eat healthily. From this we can show that any pocket of space will work with this strategy hence there wont be a dependency on location. But of course with context in which this will be more challenging if it is placed in the middle of the Central Business District. Q7: How did the various departments of GUI come about?\nFarming was a part of GUI from the start, it was to get people to touch the soil being the most fundamental activity. Over time as more people come, we also had the need to fix things when items are spoiled. There was then an opportunity for wood working. At the end of the day, these are all platforms to connect people. That is where the nature placemaking research is important due to the idea of facilitator where activities can bring together people through a common purpose.

So you may as well call the firm storytellers.\nWe Create as We Play. Inspired by the ethos of play – in which anything is possible, the firm invite others to imagine with them. Their creative solutions engender new experiences and make new connections between people and ideas.\nWhat We Create, People Enliven it. We believe people take the leading role in everything the firm creates. The firm informs and is to be informed by how people live, work and play, now and in future. The firm takes great considerations into what the society’s concerns and care for, and to make great places that the society is proud of. ABOUT Project House\nProject House is a match-making platform to re-instate the equilibrium between the supply and demand of ground-level commercial spaces in Hong Kong. These vacant spaces are rented to social enterprise or local start-ups. The once vacant city spaces are transformed into a community hub through pop-up and modular design strategies.\nProject House\n Interview with MUI Sarah of One Bite Design Studio\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nKeep trying and it will never be too late. 2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\n1. COVID-19 gives a hit on everyone, to face the fact that our urban design was not up-to-date and immediate actions should be taken to build a healthy city. It is a hard lesson, but we could see how designers and architects are responding well and moving fast.\n2. From daily work arrangement, COVID-19 has created a lot of inconvenience. However, it also gives us opportunities to try new technology in engagement process. 3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?\nThe Art of Noticing by Rob Walker. Interview Transcript\nQ1: What led to the founding of One Bite Design Studio?\nOne Bite Design Studio was set up in 2015, when the two co-founders, Alan \u0026amp; Sarah, wanted to explore how cross-disciplinary work could inform new urban ideas for their home city, Hong Kong. Q2: Is there a process for One Bite Design Studio in re-making a space as mentioned in your placemaking philosophy to kickstart a placemaking project?\nThe process of re-making space in One Bite follows our methodology called K.N.O.T. – KNOCKING on doors to understand the stakeholders, distilling the real NEEDS, ORIGINATING new ideas, believing in TRIAL and quick prototypes. KNOCKING is always the first step to get to know the neighbourhood for new and relevant insights. Q3: How do you and your team decide upon a potential vacant site to develop into the “Project House”?\nThe story of “Project House” began in 2017 when a friend owned a shop being vacant for years. Our early discussion was to use the shop as a weekend market. However, when we discussed further, we realized vacant shop space is in fact a common phenomenon in the city and we should bring up a bigger experiment. It took us 4 months for discussion and 2 more months for preparation in rolling out the first “Project House”.\nQ4: Which collaboration or activity do you have the fondest memory of?\nThe One Dollar weekend shop was one of my most memorable collaboration. It was an idea that our long-time collaborator had been sharing. Therefore, when we have decided to open “Project House”, we believed it was the best opportunity to try their experiment. This activity aligned with our belief in enabling social experiments in the city so new insights can be tested. Q5: While developing projects, there would usually be challenges and setbacks that could stem for various sources, such as societal or economical. How do you and your team work to address those challenges that might occur during or after a project development?\nAs architects, we get used to work with challenges and setbacks. We think it is crucial to have an aligned vision in each project so we know what the priorities should be when making decision. Q6: What is the immediate change you have observed on the street after the “Project House” operation?\nOne immediate change we found is the neighbours enjoyed to come back. Recurring presence of neighbours reflects the positive impact of the project. Q7: Have you and your team considered expanding the intervention of “Project House” to be incorporated with other groups or locations? What difficulties do you foresee in scaling this process up?\nWe have been expanding and continuing “Project House” in other 4 districts in the last 3 years. The most difficult part is to get available space. The whole project relies heavily on the availability of vacant shop spaces which cannot be controlled.

P!D was founded in 2013 by founders, Jan Lim and Mizah Rahman with the vision to spread the ideas of participatory design across Singapore. ABOUT Hack Our Play - St. James Church Kindergarten\nHack our play is the first community-built play space in Singapore. The project was executed in 4 phases (connect, understand, create, deliver), driven by participatory design guiding principles. It aims to allow for the primary users of the space to create a unique play environment, empowering users to take pride and ownership over the space. Hack Our Play - St. James Church Kindergarten\n Interview with YEUNG Larry of Participate in Design\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nI would like to tell myself, do not be afraid to try and step out of your comfort zone. Stay true to your own values. 2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nI think there will need to be a hybrid of methods in the “new norm”. While online engagements were seen as “the new norm”, we felt that we should not neglect the importance of physical interaction, so that our seniors or community who have no access to computers, would not be le^ out of the co-creation process.\n3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?\nJane Jacobs “Life and death of Great American cities”. This was the first book I read In architecture school that really left an impact on me, and was also one of the reason I got very interested in the field of urban planning, community and public architecture. Interview Transcript\nQ1: Could you share your latest project, and how did you and your team start connecting with the community involved?\nOur latest project is the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme in Nee Soon East, whereby we were given the task to brainstorm innova?ve ways to co-create the neighbourhood together with the residents in Nee Soon East. This project just started a few weeks ago, and we are in the midst of reaching out to the Town Council, grassroots and advisor for the area. Our first step for any new project is to first understand the community a little more through the above mentioned stakeholders, before doing the actual ground work with the residents. We are excited to connect with the residents through various means such as the upcoming walking conversa?ons and community workshops. If you stay near Nee Soon East, do keep a lookout for these community engagements! Q2: Everybody’s needs are different, and opinions have been extensively collected in the first 2 phases of every project. Thoughts from every stakeholder might be vastly different or at times even clashing. How does the organisation consolidate and converge the thoughts of the community?\nThere will hardly be any community engagement with all views aligned,. At some point, there will likely be conflicting views. But most importantly, I would say the par?cipatory design process is about crea?ng this plaNorm for the community and designers/space managers to empathise with one another, so that each of them can understand one another’s perspec?ve. With such understanding, we can then mobilise the community to work towards a common vision of the space. At the end of the day, we are there to listen and co-design with the “local experts” (in this case the residents), and collabora?on between all stakeholders and the design experts can create a meaningful change in the built outcome. Q3: What is your vision for participatory design to be used as an approach for community designs? Do you think all projects should adopt participation from the community? Are there any cases you can think of for which par8cipatory design might not significantly value-add to a community project?\nMy vision is for more public projects to adopt a participatory design framework from the beginning of the project so that the design brief could be shaped more meaningfully. A lot of times we only start engaging the community at the later part of the project, and by then, we realise that a lot of assumptions were already made, and the scope which the community could influence the end outcome is extremely limited. That may in some cases cause the public project to look good as a space/architecture, but fail to serve the community in the long run. That being said, I do feel that not every project need to adopt participation from the community. Some examples are conservation projects. When it comes to deciding what architecture to preserve, it requires some degree of knowledge of conservation and architectural history to decide what needs to be preserved, and these are some things that require more of an expert point of view. So in this case, I do not see public participation as crucial in this case. However, public participation can come in at a later part to perhaps decide what programmes can go along in the conserved spaces. Q4: What do you think can be done or what precautions may be taken to ensure community spaces can be designed to stay relevant?\nI would say for community spaces and design to work, one must really understand who are you designing the space for. You need to take time to understand the community. Only then, you will be able to design something meaningful that can relate to the community. Like how Jan Gehl puts it, “First life, then spaces, then buildings - the other way around never works.” Q5: What are some projects that you would like to do, but are unable to because of certain restrictions from the government?\nI do not have such project so far. I would say however, there are some ideas which we wanted to propose but was not able to implement due to some operational reasons. One of which are movable furniture in public spaces, which has many concerns regarding theft and maintenance. Q6: For the “Hack Our Play” series, is the research and understanding phase repeated for the different sites or how did you manage to adapt the general ideas learned to the different scales, objectives and age groups?\nFor Hack Our Play, we worked on one site, which is within a privately owned space at St James Kindergarten. We hoped to demonstrate to our partners and public agencies that such a methodology could be applied to different sites through this project. We documented our research journey, and also shared with the public what methodology worked for us, and some challenges we faced, so that they will be able to adjust these methodology according to the different sites they choose to work with. The toolkit is available for free at www.hackourplay.com. Q7: Do the public spaces created with upcycled materials tend to be temporary in nature (be it as a play environment or in terms of maintenance of these materials)? Are the spaces created with upcycled materials as appreciated, or perhaps even more appreciated than its counterpart that are associated with more permanent structures?\nThe concept of using upcycled materials was to create a space that will constantly evolve over time. So it was meant to be more transitionary from the beginning. From our observation and feedback from the teachers, kids enjoyed the upcycled space more because it was built by themselves and their parents, they feel a greater sense of pride towards the space. Some feedback we got was also that the upcycled space offers more elements that can be customised to their liking, therefore able to accommodate more of their imaginative play during their play time. The fact that it will constantly evolve also adds some excitement for the kids and educators as it is a space that can constant change based on different students’ and educators’ imagination. Q8: During the time of the Covid-19 outbreak, was the P!D able to adapt the participatory design principles to contribute to any community in an innova8ve way to help cope with the situation?\nWe have to move a lot of our engagements online. And that to us is something new, because we always have been doing physical engagements, and doing engagement online is something new for us. But how might we do engagement online but still doing it in a fun and accessible manner, that is what we are constantly trying to innovate. Also, there are communities that may not be present online, so how do we still reach out to them during such times?

As community designers, the firm focuses on empowering the local people to participate in problem solving in their neighbourhoods. A typical workflow of a project consists of researching on case studies, conducting interviews and workshops as well as connecting different people in the local community to be involved in the project. Studio L was founded by Ryo Yamazaki together with Takanori Daigo, Shinji Kanba and Arisa Nishigami in 2005 (previously known as Seikatsu Studio). Its early years saw the team working on projects such as the renewal of a magazine delivered from a park management organisation in Osaka and the Senri Rehabilitation Hospital Project which helped Ryo Yamazaki to recognise a new role of a community designer. ABOUT Hajimari Art Center\nHajimari Art Center is a small museum, established by renovating a 130-years sake brewery. It aims to provide opportunities to develop a tolerant and creative society by encouraging art expression and connection among people. Hajimari Art Center\n Interview with Noriko DENO, Hwana HONG, and Sayaka HIRANO of studio-L\nInsights and Takeaways\n1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?\nDeno San: I do not have a background in architecture or landscape architecture, but I think getting the local residents involved in the design process is very important. It is important to think about how people would use the building after it is open instead of focusing on creating a lovely nice building. In my opinion, incorporating the locals’ opinions as well as local culture in the design is very important.\nWe work with architects as well. The workshops are conducted prior to the design such that they could reflect the opinions and the culture of the locals and provide insights to how people might use the building. These would be incorporated into the design by the architects.\nHong San: I think workshops are also a good time for residents to think about their lives, how they would like to live in their city. It gives them the opportunity to design their lives in the future.\nDeno San: Workshops provide the opportunity for people to think about their lives and learn about their surroundings. People are not necessarily aware about the things happening around them. People living in Tokyo might not know about their neighbours but people living in small towns might know almost everything. This kind of information is very important for local residents so that they know where to seek help or know who to help, especially in the context of natural disasters. Workshops essentially help residents learn about their surrounding and spark them to think about what they want to do in their lives, what they need and what the neighbourhood needs. It is important to design this into the workshops such that people can talk not only about the upcoming building but also share their lives. All these insights would inform a better design of the building and its landscape. The role of studio-L sometimes is to look after the management of the built environment. There was this park that was designed and built 10 years ago but there was the shortage of park visitors. The park management approached studio-L to explore how they could increase the park usage among residents. So, It is very important to think about how the building is going to be used after its built. 2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?\nHong San: In Japan there was no constitutional law to prevent people going out. However, the government did request us to stay at home. So, most people stay at home and staying at home for too long causes stress, especially to families raising children. I heard in the Tachikawa Children Future Center, coordinators have been coordinating different community groups to reach out and help affected people in the community. The community groups help disseminate important information as well as conduct activities such as sharing sessions where people could come and share their experiences so as to not keep their stress bottled in. Community support is also available to residents who need it. Deno San: The nature of community design is to be able to interact with each other face to face. With COVID-19, it is hard and we have been trying all sorts of online methods to figure out which one works the best. I think it is important to make people feel that they are connected to each other somehow. In the past workshops used to be designed to last 2 to 3 hours. However, it is very tiring to sit in front of a screen for that duration. With online workshops it is cut down to approximately 90 mins. There is also a time allocated in the workshops for the participants to talk about anything or share their life which need not be related to the project or the theme of the workshop. I think talking to people really helps. It is also important to schedule meetings in advance and set a date for next meeting. __Interview Transcript__\n__Q1: -__\n- -- ","date":"16","image":"images/post/17_studio-L_01.jpg","month":"Jun","permalink":"/post/studio_l/","tags":["Citizen Participation","Cultural Preservation"],"title":"studio-L"}]
