<span style="color:#E7451F">__ABOUT One Bite Design Studio__</span><br>
One Bite is a creative team of strategists, architects, designers, community outreach managers and event managers. Headquartered in Hong Kong with an office in Singapore, the firm has been involved in various architectural, interior design; art and pop-up installations; visual communication and social creative projects in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia since 2014. Placemaking is in the team's DNA and they strive to bridge the gaps between space, place and the society by constantly exploring the synergies among their stakeholders. <br>

One Bite Design Studio's Philosophy: <br>
We Narrate as We Create. At One Bite, a design always starts with a story, because it is stories that connect people to space, and it is within space where experience and memories unfold. So you may as well call the firm storytellers.<br>
We Create as We Play. Inspired by the ethos of play -- in which anything is possible, the firm invite others to imagine with them. Their creative solutions engender new experiences and make new connections between people and ideas.<br>
What We Create, People Enliven it. We believe people take the leading role in everything the firm creates. The firm informs and is to be informed by how people live, work and play, now and in future. The firm takes great considerations into what the society’s concerns and care for, and to make great places that the society is proud of. <br><br>

Project House is a match-making platform to re-instate the equilibrium between the supply and demand of ground-level commercial spaces in Hong Kong. These vacant spaces are rented to social enterprise or local start-ups. The once vacant city spaces are transformed into a community hub through pop-up and modular design strategies.<br><br>

__1. ADVICE TO YOUNG ARCHITECTS?__<br>
Keep trying and it will never be too late. <br><br>

__2. HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR WORK?__<br>
1. COVID-19 gives a hit on everyone, to face the fact that our urban design was not up-to-date and immediate actions should be taken to build a healthy city. It is a hard lesson, but we could see how designers and architects are responding well and moving fast.<br>
2. From daily work arrangement, COVID-19 has created a lot of inconvenience. However, it also gives us opportunities to try new technology in engagement process. <br><br>

__3. BOOKS TO RECOMMEND?__<br>

<span style="color:#E7451F">__Interview Transcript__</span><br>
__Q1: What led to the founding of One Bite Design Studio?__<br>
One Bite Design Studio was set up in 2015, when the two co-founders, Alan & Sarah, wanted to explore how cross-disciplinary work could inform new urban ideas for their home city, Hong Kong. <br><br>

__Q2: Is there a process for One Bite Design Studio in re-making a space as mentioned in your placemaking philosophy to kickstart a placemaking project?__<br>
The process of re-making space in One Bite follows our methodology called K.N.O.T. – KNOCKING on doors to understand the stakeholders, distilling the real NEEDS, ORIGINATING new ideas, believing in TRIAL and quick prototypes. KNOCKING is always the first step to get to know the neighbourhood for new and relevant insights. <br><br>

__Q3: How do you and your team decide upon a potential vacant site to develop into the “Project House”?__<br>
The story of “Project House” began in 2017 when a friend owned a shop being vacant for years. Our early discussion was to use the shop as a weekend market. However, when we discussed further, we realized vacant shop space is in fact a common phenomenon in the city and we should bring up a bigger experiment. It took us 4 months for discussion and 2 more months for preparation in rolling out the first “Project House”.<br><br>

__Q4: Which collaboration or activity do you have the fondest memory of?__<br>
The One Dollar weekend shop was one of my most memorable collaboration. It was an idea that our long-time collaborator had been sharing. Therefore, when we have decided to open “Project House”, we believed it was the best opportunity to try their experiment. This activity aligned with our belief in enabling social experiments in the city so new insights can be tested. <br><br>

__Q5: While developing projects, there would usually be challenges and setbacks that could stem for various sources, such as societal or economical. How do you and your team work to address those challenges that might occur during or after a project development?__<br>
As architects, we get used to work with challenges and setbacks. We think it is crucial to have an aligned vision in each project so we know what the priorities should be when making decision. <br><br>

__Q6: What is the immediate change you have observed on the street after the “Project House” operation?__<br>
One immediate change we found is the neighbours enjoyed to come back. Recurring presence of neighbours reflects the positive impact of the project. <br><br>

__Q7: Have you and your team considered expanding the intervention of “Project House” to be incorporated with other groups or locations? What difficulties do you foresee in scaling this process up?__<br>
We have been expanding and continuing “Project House” in other 4 districts in the last 3 years. The most difficult part is to get available space. The whole project relies heavily on the availability of vacant shop spaces which cannot be controlled. <br><br>
