<p><span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>ABOUT VTN Architects</strong></span><br>
VTN Architects is a well-known architectural firm in Vietnam, with two branches, located in Hanoi and Ho Chi Mihn city. The firm mainly focuses on cultural, residential, and commercial projects for both local and international clients.<br>
Vo Trong Nghia, an architectural graduate from University of Tokyo, founded VTN Architects in 2006. The main design philosophy behind his firm is to create an architecture that is a fusion between vernacular and contemporary design, while simultaneously integrating a sustainable and green system. This can be achieved through research, exploration, and experimentation of natural and local materials and the benefits of the existing site. <br>
VTN Architects has worked on various projects that have won awards of different categories, both locally and internationally. Recently in 2019, Bamboo Stalactite Pavilion, Breathing House, and Nocenco Cafe projects won the Green Good. While Diamond Island Community Hall, Naman Retreat Babylon, Farming Kindergarten projects won the International Architecture Award in 2015. <br><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#E7451F"><strong>ABOUT Pou Chen Vietnam</strong></span><br>
Farming Kindergarten is an educational space for low income children of factory workers. The design integrates greenery throughout, not only to help achieve a sustainable design, but to also expose the children to the agricultural scene of Vietnam and to create a fun and vibrant place for them to learn and play <br><br></p>

- <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Q2: Many of your projects aim to tackle issues that Vietnam is facing, such as lack of greenery, overheating, pollution, and flooding, to what extent do you think these issues can be solved through architecture and design?</strong><br>
-<br><br></p>
<p>__Q3: Projects like the “Farming Kindergarten” are designed for children from low income families, how does the architecture and the understanding of local context respond to the program? <br>
-<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Q4:In what sense do you think the project is successful in serving its purpose, and if you could go back, are there anything you would have done or designed differently?</strong><br></p>
